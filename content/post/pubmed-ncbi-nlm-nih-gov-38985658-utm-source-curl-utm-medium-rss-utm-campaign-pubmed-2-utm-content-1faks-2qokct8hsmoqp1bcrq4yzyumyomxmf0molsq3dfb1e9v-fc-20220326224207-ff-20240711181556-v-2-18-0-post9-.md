description: One of a major function of programmed cell death (apoptosis) is the removal
  of cells which suffered oncogenic mutations, thereby preventing cancerous transformation.
  By making use of a Double-Headed-EP (DEP) transposon, a P element derivative made
  in our laboratory, we made an insertional mutagenesis screen in Drosophila melanogaster
  to identify genes which, when overexpressed, suppress the p53-activated apoptosis.
  The DEP element has Gal4-activatable, outward-directed UAS-promoters at both ...
