description: The cellular environment, characterized by its intricate composition
  and spatial organization, hosts a variety of organelles, ranging from membrane-bound
  ones to membraneless structures that are formed through liquid-liquid phase separation.
  Cells show precise control over the position of such condensates. We demonstrate
  that organelle movement in external concentration gradients, diffusiophoresis, is
  distinct from the one of colloids because fluxes can remain finite inside the ...
