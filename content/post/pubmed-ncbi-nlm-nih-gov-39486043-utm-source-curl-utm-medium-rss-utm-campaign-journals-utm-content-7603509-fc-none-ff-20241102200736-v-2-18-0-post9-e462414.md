description: Long-term outcomes with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) show that their
  impact on CML is sustained as shown by 13 studies with 5- to 14-year-follow-up and
  numerous shorter-term studies of newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML. Twenty-five
  years of imatinib (IM)-treatment confirm its beneficial effect on survival and possibly
  cure of CML. Large randomized academic treatment optimization studies have confirmed
  and extended the pivotal International Randomized Study on Interferon and STI571
