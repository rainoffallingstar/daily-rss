description: Current guidelines recommend oxygen (O(2)) supplementation in patients
  with pulmonary hypertension (PH), despite scarce data on long-term O(2) therapy
  (LTOT). The aim of this prospective, randomized, controlled trial was to investigate
  the effect of LTOT in patients with precapillary PH on exercise capacity, clinical
  parameters and hemodynamics. Patients with precapillary PH under stable therapy
  and O(2) desaturations at rest and/or during exercise were randomized to receive
  LTOT (≥ 16 h/day) ...
