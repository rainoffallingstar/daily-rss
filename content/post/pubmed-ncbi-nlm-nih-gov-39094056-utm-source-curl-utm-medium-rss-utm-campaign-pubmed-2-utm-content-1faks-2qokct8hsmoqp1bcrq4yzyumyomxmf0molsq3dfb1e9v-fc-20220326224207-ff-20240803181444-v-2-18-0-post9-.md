description: Apicomplexan parasites are a group of eukaryotic protozoans with diverse
  biology that have affected human health like no other group of parasites. These
  obligate intracellular parasites rely on their cytoskeletal structures for giving
  them form, enabling them to replicate in unique ways and to migrate across tissue
  barriers. Recent progress in transgenesis and imaging tools allowed detailed insights
  into the components making up and regulating the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton
  as well ...
