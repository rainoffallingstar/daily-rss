description: The modulation of actin polymerization is a common theme among microbial
  pathogens. Even though microorganisms show a wide repertoire of strategies to subvert
  the activity of actin, most of them converge in the ones that activate nucleating
  factors, such as the Arp2/3 complex. Brucella spp. are intracellular pathogens capable
  of establishing chronic infections in their hosts. The ability to subvert the host
  cell response is dependent on the capacity of the bacterium to attach, invade, ...
