description: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) methods unlock molecular mechanisms underlying
  tissue development, homeostasis, or disease. However, there is a need for easy-to-use,
  high-resolution, cost-efficient, and 3D-scalable methods. Here, we report Open-ST,
  a sequencing-based, open-source experimental and computational resource to address
  these challenges and to study the molecular organization of tissues in 2D and 3D.
  In mouse brain, Open-ST captured transcripts at subcellular resolution and ...
