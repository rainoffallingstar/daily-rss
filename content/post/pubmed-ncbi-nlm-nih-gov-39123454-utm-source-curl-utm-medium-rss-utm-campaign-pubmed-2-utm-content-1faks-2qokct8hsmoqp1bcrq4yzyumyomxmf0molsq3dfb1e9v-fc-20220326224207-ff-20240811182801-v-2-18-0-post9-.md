description: Early detection of PDAC remains challenging due to the lack of early
  symptoms and the absence of reliable biomarkers. The aim of the present project
  was to identify miRNA and proteomics signatures discriminating PDAC patients with
  DM from nondiabetic PDAC patients. Proteomics analysis and miRNA array were used
  for protein and miRNA screening. We used Western blotting and Real-Time Quantitative
  Reverse Transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for protein and miRNA
  validation. ...
