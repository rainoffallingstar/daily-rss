description: After recognizing its ligand lipopolysaccharide, Toll-like receptor 4
  (TLR4) recruits adaptor proteins to the cell membrane, thereby initiating downstream
  signaling and triggering inflammation. Whether this recruitment of adaptor proteins
  is dependent solely on protein-protein interactions is unknown. Here, we report
  that the sphingolipid sphinganine physically interacts with the adaptor proteins
  MyD88 and TIRAP and promotes MyD88 recruitment in macrophages. Myeloid cell-specific
