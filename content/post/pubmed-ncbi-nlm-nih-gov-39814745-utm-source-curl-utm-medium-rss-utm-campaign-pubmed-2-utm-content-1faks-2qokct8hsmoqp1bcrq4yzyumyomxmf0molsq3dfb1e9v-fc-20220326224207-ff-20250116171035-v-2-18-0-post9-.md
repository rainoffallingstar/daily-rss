description: The Nord Stream pipeline leaks on 26 September 2022 released 465 ± 20
  kt of methane into the atmosphere, which is the largest recorded transient anthropogenic
  methane emission event. While most of the gas escaped directly to the atmosphere,
  a fraction dissolved in the water. So far, studies on the fate of this dissolved
  methane rely on pipeline volumetric estimates or spatially sparse concentration
  measurements and ocean models. Here, we use atmospheric measurements with broad
  spatial ...
