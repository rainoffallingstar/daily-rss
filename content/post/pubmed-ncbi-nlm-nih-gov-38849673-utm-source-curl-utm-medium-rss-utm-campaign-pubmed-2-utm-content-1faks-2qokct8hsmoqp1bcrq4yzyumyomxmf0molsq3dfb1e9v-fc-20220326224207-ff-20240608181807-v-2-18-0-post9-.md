description: Polarized vesicular trafficking directs specific receptors and ion channels
  to cilia, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we describe
  a role for DLG1, a core component of the Scribble polarity complex, in regulating
  ciliary protein trafficking in kidney epithelial cells. Conditional knockout of
  Dlg1 in mouse kidney causes ciliary elongation and cystogenesis, and cell-based
  proximity labeling proteomics and fluorescence microscopy show alterations in the
  ciliary ...
