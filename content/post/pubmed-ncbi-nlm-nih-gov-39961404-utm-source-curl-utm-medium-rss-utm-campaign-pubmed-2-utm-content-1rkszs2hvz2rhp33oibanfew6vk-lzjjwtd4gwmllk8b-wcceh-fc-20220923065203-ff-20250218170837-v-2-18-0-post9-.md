description: Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) is a highly malignant embryonal
  brain tumor driven by genetic alterations inactivating the SMARCB1 or, less commonly,
  the SMARCA4 gene. Large-scale molecular profiling studies have identified distinct
  molecular subtypes termed AT/RT-TYR, -SHH and -MYC. Despite the increasing knowledge
  of AT/RT biology, curative treatment options are still lacking for certain risk
  groups and outcomes of these patients remain poor. We performed an in vitro ...
