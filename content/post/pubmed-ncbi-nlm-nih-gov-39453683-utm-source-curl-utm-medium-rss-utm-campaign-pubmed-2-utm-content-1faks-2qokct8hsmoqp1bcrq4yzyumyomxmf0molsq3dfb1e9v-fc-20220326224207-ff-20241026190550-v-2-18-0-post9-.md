description: 'CONCLUSIONS: TaqMan array card measurements were found to be biologically
  valid and technically reproducible. The BioPac multianalyte marker panel is capable
  of sensitive and accurate detection of recurrence in patients resected for PDAC
  using a simple blood test. This could allow a closer follow-up using shorter time
  intervals than currently used for imaging, thus potentially prompting an earlier
  work-up with additional modalities to allow for earlier therapeutic intervention.
