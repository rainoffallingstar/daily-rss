description: Since clinical features of chronic muscle pain originating from the low
  back and limbs are different (higher prevalence and broader/duller sensation of
  low back muscle pain than limb muscle pain), spinal and/or supraspinal projection
  of nociceptive information could differ between the two muscles. We tested this
  hypothesis using c-Fos immunohistochemistry combined with retrograde-labeling of
  dorsal horn (DH) neurons projecting to ventrolateral periaqueductal grey (vlPAG)
  or ...
