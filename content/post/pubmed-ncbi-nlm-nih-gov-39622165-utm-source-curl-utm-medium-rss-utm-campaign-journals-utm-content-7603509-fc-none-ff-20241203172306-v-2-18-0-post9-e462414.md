description: Treatment options for stage I/II bulky and advanced stage disease have
  recently extensively changed. For decades in North America, ABVD has been a frontline
  standard of care option for patients with advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL).
  Recent data on combining brentuximab vedotin, doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine
  demonstrated improved overall survival compared to ABVD but increased adverse events
