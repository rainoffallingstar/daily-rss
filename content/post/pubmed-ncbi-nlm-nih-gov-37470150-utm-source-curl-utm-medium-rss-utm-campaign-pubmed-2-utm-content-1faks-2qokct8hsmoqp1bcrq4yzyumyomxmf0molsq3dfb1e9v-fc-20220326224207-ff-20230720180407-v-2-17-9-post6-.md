  patients (R/R AML) are limited. This retrospective cohort study compares safety
  and efficacy of fludarabine, cytarabine, and idarubicin (FLA-IDA) with or without
  venetoclax in patients with R/R AML. Thirty-seven and 81 patients received one course
  FLA-IDA with or without a 7-day course of venetoclax, respectively. The overall
  response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in FLAVIDA compared to FLA-IDA treated
  patients (78% ...
