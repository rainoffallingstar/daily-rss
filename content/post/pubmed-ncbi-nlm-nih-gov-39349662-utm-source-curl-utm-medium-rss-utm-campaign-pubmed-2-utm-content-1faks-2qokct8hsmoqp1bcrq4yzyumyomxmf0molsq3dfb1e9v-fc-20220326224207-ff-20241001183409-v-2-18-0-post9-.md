description: Germinal matrix hemorrhage (GMH) is a devastating neurodevelopmental
  condition affecting preterm infants, but why blood vessels in this brain region
  are vulnerable to rupture remains unknown. Here we show that microglia in prenatal
  mouse and human brain interact with nascent vasculature in an age-dependent manner
  and that ablation of these cells in mice reduces angiogenesis in the ganglionic
  eminences, which correspond to the human germinal matrix. Consistent with these
  findings, ...
