description: An emerging biomarker of blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability is the
  time of exchange (Tex) of water from the blood to tissue, as measured by multi-echo
  arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI. This new non-invasive sequence, already tested
  in mice, has recently been adapted to humans and optimized for clinical scanning
  time. In this study, we studied the normal variability of Tex over age and sex,
  which needs to be established as a reference for studying changes in neurological
  disease. We ...
