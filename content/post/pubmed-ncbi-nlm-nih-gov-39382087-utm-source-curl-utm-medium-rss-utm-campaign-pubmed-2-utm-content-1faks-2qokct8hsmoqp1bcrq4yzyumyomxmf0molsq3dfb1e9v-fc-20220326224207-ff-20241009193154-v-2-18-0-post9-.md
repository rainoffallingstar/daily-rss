description: The most common and aggressive brain cancer, glioblastoma, is characterized
  by hypoxia and poor survival. The pro-tumour transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible
  factor (HIF), is regulated via HIF-hydroxylases that require ascorbate as cofactor.
  Decreased HIF-hydroxylase activity triggers the hypoxic pathway driving cancer progression.
  Tissue ascorbate accumulates via the sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter-2 (SVCT2).
