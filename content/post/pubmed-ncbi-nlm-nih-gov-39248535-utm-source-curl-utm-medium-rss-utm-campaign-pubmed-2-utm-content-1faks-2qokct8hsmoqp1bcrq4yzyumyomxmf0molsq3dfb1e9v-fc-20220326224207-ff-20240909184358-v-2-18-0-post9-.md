description: 'CONCLUSION: This study suggests that neuromas seem to continue to grow
  over time and that smaller nerves may form relatively larger neuromas. In addition,
  sensory nerves develop relatively larger neuromas compared with mixed nerves. Neuroma
  size does not appear to correlate with pain severity. These findings may stimulate
  future research efforts and contribute to a better understanding of symptomatic
