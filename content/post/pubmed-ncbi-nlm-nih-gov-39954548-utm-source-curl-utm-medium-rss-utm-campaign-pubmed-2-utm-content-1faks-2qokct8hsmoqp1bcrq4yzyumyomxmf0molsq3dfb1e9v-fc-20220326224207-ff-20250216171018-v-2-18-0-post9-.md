description: Glycogen storage disease (GSD) type Ia (glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency)
  and Ib (glucose-6-phosphate transporter deficiency) are both clinically characterized
  by fasting hypoglycaemia and hepatomegaly. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) with loss
  of glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria/proteinuria is a known long-term complication
  of GSD I that has become less frequent with improvement of therapy over the last
  decades. We retrospectively investigated a cohort of 63 GSD I patients (51 GSD Ia,
