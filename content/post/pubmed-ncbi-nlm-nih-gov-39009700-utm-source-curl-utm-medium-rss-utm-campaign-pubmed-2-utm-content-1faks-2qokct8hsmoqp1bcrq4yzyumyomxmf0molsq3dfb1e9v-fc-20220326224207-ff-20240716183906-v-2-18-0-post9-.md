description: The mitochondrial cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has
  been portrayed through molecular, cellular, and animal studies; however large epidemiological
  studies are lacking. This study aimed to explore the association of mitochondrial
  DNA copy number (mtDNAcn), a marker representative of mtDNA abundance per cell,
  with risk of incident all-cause dementia, AD, and vascular dementia diagnosis within
  17 years and dementia-related blood biomarkers (P-tau181, GFAP, and NfL). ...
