description: PSMA-targeted PET/CT is currently considered the most effective non-invasive
  diagnostic technique for imaging PSMA-positive lesions in prostate cancer (PC),
  and its introduction has significantly enhanced the role of nuclear medicine in
  both the diagnosis and therapy (theranostics) of this oncological entity. In line
  with developments in radiopharmaceuticals, significant progress has been made in
