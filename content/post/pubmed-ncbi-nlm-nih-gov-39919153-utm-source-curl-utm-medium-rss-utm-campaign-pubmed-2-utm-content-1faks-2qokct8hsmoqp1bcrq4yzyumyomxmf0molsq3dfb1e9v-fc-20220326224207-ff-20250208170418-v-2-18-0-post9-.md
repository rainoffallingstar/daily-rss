description: High-frequency electrical stimulation (HFS) of the skin using a multi-pin
  electrode activating epidermal nociceptors is used to explore spinal central sensitization
  in humans. Most previous studies applied HFS to the volar forearm. To prepare for
  clinical applications in which HFS could be applied to different body sites, this
  study compared the secondary hyperalgesia induced by stimulation of the foot dorsum
  vs. the forearm in 32 healthy volunteers. HFS consisted in five 1-s trains of 100
