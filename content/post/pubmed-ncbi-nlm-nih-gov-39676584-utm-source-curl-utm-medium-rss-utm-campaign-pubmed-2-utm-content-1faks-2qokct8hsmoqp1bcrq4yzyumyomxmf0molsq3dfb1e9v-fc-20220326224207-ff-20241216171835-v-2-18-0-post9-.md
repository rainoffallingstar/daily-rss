description: Existing literature has documented diminished norm-based adaptation (aftereffects)
  across several perceptual domains in autism. However, the exact underlying mechanisms,
  such as sensory dominance possibly caused by imprecise priors and/or increased sensory
  precision, remain elusive. The "Bayesian brain" framework offers refined methods
  to investigate these mechanisms. This study utilized both model-free (frequentist
  statistics) and model-based (hierarchical Drift Diffusion Modeling) ...
