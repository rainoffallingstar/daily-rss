description: Immune activation status determines non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
  prognosis, with reported positive/negative associations for T helper type 2 (TH2)
  responses, including allergen-specific IgE and eosinophils. Our study seeks to explore
  the potential impact of these comorbid immune responses on the survival rates of
  patients with NSCLC. Our retrospective study used data from the Data Warehouse of
  the German Center for Lung Research (DZL) and Lung Biobank at Thoraxklinik Heidelberg.
