description: Because of the low mutational burden and consequently, fewer potential
  neoantigens, children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are thought to have a T
  cell-depleted or 'cold' tumor microenvironment and may have a low likelihood of
  response to T cell-directed immunotherapies. Understanding the composition, phenotype,
  and spatial organization of T cells and other microenvironmental populations in
  the pediatric AML bone marrow (BM) is essential for informing future immunotherapeutic
  trials ...
