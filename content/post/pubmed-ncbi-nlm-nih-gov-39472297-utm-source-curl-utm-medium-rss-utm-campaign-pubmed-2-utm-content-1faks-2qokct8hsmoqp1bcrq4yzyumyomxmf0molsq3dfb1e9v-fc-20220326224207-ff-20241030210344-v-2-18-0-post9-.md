description: The ARP2/3 complex, which orchestrates actin cytoskeleton organization
  and lamellipodia formation, has been implicated in the initiation of pancreatic
  ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This study aims to clarify its impact on the activity
  of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), key players in PDAC progression, and patient
  outcomes. Early pancreatic carcinogenesis was modeled in p48^(Cre); LSL-Kras^(G12D)
  mice with caerulein-induced pancreatitis, complemented by in vitro studies on ...
