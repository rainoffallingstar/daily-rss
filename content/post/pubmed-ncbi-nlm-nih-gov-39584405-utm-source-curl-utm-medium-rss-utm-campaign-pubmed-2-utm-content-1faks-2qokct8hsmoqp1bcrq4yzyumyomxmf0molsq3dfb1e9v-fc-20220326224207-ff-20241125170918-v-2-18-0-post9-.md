description: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a dynamic and continuous membrane network
  with roles in many cellular processes. The importance and maintenance of ER structure
  and function have been extensively studied in interphase cells, yet recent findings
  also indicate crucial roles of the ER in mitosis. During mitosis, the ER is remodelled
  significantly with respect to composition and morphology but persists as a continuous
  network. The ER interacts with microtubules, actin and intermediate ...
