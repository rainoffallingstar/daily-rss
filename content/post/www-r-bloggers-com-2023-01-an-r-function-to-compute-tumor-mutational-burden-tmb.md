  <p>Tumor mutational (or mutation) burden, TMB, is considered a useful estimation of tumor neoantigenic load (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6336005/) and a biomarker of sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitors (https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-017-0424-2). Computing TMB is relatively easy. Together with a ...</p>
