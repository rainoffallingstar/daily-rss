description: Ruminococcus gnavus is a gut bacterium found in > 90% of healthy individuals,
  but its increased abundance is also associated with chronic inflammatory diseases,
  particularly Crohn's disease. Nevertheless, its global distribution and intraspecies
  genomic variation remain understudied. By surveying 12,791 gut metagenomes, we recapitulated
  known associations with metabolic diseases and inflammatory bowel disease. We uncovered
  a higher prevalence and abundance of R. gnavus in Westernized ...
