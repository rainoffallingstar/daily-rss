description: Germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (gBRCA1/2) are required for a PARP
  inhibitor therapy in patients with HER2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer
  (aBC). However, little is known about the prognostic impact of gBRCA1/2 mutations
  in aBC patients treated with chemotherapy. This study aimed to investigate the frequencies
  and prognosis of germline and somatic BRCA1/2 mutations in HER2- aBC patients receiving
  the first chemotherapy in the advanced setting. Patients receiving their ...
