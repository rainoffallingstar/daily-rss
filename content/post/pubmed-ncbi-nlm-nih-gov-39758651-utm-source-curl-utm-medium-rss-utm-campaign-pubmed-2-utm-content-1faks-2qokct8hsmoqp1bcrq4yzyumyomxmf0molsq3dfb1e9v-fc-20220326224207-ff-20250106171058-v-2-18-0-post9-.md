description: By possibly bridging the gap between 2D in vitro cell assays and in vivo
  applications, tumor cell spheroid cultures offer promising avenues for advancing
  innovation in nuclear medicine. Regarding the in vitro evaluation of therapeutic
  radioligands, tumor cell spheroids have been successfully used to assess the therapeutic
  efficacy against human tumors. However, studies employing spheroids for testing
  diagnostic tracers are missing. The present work investigated the receptor interaction
