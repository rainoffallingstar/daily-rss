description: 'CONCLUSION: We found no evidence that BRCA1/2 PV carriers have an increased
  CAYA cancer risk aside from breast cancer in women in their 20''s. Our results,
  along with a critical evaluation of previous germline sequencing studies, suggest
  that the childhood and adolescent cancer risk conferred by BRCA1/2 PV would be low
  (ie, RR < 2) if it existed. Our findings do not support PV testing for offspring
  of BRCA1/2 PV carriers at ages <18 years, nor for conducting BRCA1/2 PV testing
  for childhood ...'
