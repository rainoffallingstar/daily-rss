description: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of contrast media application
  on CT attenuation of the bone using a novel calcium-only imaging technique (VCa)
  from dual-layer spectral detector CT (DLCT), which enables CT-based bone mineral
  density measurement unimpeded by soft tissue components. For this, true non-contrast
  (TNC) and venous phase images (VP) of n = 97 patients were acquired. CT attenuation
  of the first lumbar vertebra (L1) was measured in TNC-VCa, VP-VCa, and in virtual
