description: Elevated body mass index (BMI) is linked to increased pancreatic cancer
  (PC) risk. Cancer-associated weight loss can occur years before the malignancy is
  diagnosed. This might have led to underestimation of the BMI-PC association. However,
  it is unknown if and to what extent this issue has been considered in previous epidemiological
  studies. We searched two databases through February 19, 2024 for systematic reviews,
  meta-analyses, and pooled analyses examining the BMI-PC association. ...
