description: The duplication-triplication/inverted-duplication (DUP-TRP/INV-DUP) structure
  is a complex genomic rearrangement (CGR). Although it has been identified as an
  important pathogenic DNA mutation signature in genomic disorders and cancer genomes,
  its architecture remains unresolved. Here, we studied the genomic architecture of
  DUP-TRP/INV-DUP by investigating the DNA of 24 patients identified by array comparative
  genomic hybridization (aCGH) on whom we found evidence for the existence of 4 out
