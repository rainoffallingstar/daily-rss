description: The liver hormone hepcidin regulates systemic iron homeostasis to provide
  enough iron for vital processes while limiting toxicity. Hepcidin acts by degrading
  its receptor ferroportin (encoded by Slc40a1) to decrease iron export to plasma.
  Iron controls hepcidin production in part by inducing liver endothelial cells (LECs)
  to produce bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which activate hepcidin transcription
  in hepatocytes. Here, we used in vitro and in vivo models to investigate ...
