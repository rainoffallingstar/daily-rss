description: This article represents the first foray into investigating the consequences
  of various material combinations on the short-wave infrared (SWIR, 1000-2000 nm)
  performance of Tm-based core-shell nanocrystals (NCs) above 1600 nm. In total, six
  different material combinations involving two different types of SWIR-emitting core
  NCs (α-NaTmF(4) and LiTmF(4)) combined with three different protecting shell materials
  (α-NaYF(4), CaF(2), and LiYF(4)) have been synthesized. All corresponding homo-
