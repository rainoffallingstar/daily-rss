description: 'CONCLUSION: Compared to ESBLs, both GCN and Graph SAGE demonstrate excellent
  performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and an F1-score of 0.94. These results
  indicate that GCN and Graph SAGE are highly effective in predicting drug-gene associations
  related to ESBLs. GCN and Graph SAGE outperform GAT in predicting drug-gene associations
  for ESBLs. Improvements include data augmentation, regularization, and cross-validation.
  Ethical considerations, fairness, and open-source implementations ...'
