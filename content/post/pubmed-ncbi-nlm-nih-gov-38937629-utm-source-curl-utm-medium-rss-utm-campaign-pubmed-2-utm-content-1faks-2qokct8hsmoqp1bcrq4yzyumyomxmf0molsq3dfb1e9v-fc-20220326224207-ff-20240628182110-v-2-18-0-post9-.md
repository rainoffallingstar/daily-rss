description: The EMT-transcription factor ZEB1 is heterogeneously expressed in tumor
  cells and in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in colorectal cancer (CRC). While
  ZEB1 in tumor cells regulates metastasis and therapy resistance, its role in CAFs
  is largely unknown. Combining fibroblast-specific Zeb1 deletion with immunocompetent
  mouse models of CRC, we observe that inflammation-driven tumorigenesis is accelerated,
  whereas invasion and metastasis in sporadic cancers are reduced. ...
