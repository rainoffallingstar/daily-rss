description: Ageing is the accumulation of changes and decline of function of organisms
  over time. The concept and biomarkers of biological age have been established, notably
  DNA methylation-based clocks. The emergence of single-cell DNA methylation profiling
  methods opens the possibility of studying the biological age of individual cells.
  Here, we generate a large single-cell DNA methylation and transcriptome dataset
  from mouse peripheral blood samples, spanning a broad range of ages. The number
