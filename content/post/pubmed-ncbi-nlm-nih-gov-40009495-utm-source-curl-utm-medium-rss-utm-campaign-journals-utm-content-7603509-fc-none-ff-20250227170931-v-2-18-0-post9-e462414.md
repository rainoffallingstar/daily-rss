description: The rationale for combining ibrutinib and venetoclax (IV) in chronic
  lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treatment lies in their complementary mechanisms of action.
  Studies investigating IV typically begin with a short initial course of ibrutinib,
  followed by venetoclax introduction for a limited duration, typically 12 months.
  SAKK34/17 (NCT03708003) is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase 2 trial
  evaluating the effectiveness of a modified IV schedule in patients with relapsed/refractory
