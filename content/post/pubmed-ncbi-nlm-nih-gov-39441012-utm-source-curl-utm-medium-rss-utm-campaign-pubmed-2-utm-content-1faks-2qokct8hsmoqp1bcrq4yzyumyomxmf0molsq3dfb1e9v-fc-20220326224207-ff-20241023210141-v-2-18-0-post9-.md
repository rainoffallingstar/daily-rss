description: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are valuable targets for liquid biopsy.
  However, attempts to introduce EV-based biomarkers into clinical practice have not
  been successful to the extent expected. One of the reasons for this failure is the
  lack of reliable methods for EV baseline purification from complex biofluids, such
  as cell-free plasma or serum. Because available one-step approaches for EV isolation
  are insufficient to purify EVs, the majority of studies on clinical samples were
