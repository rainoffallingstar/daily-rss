description: The genomic, genetic and cellular events regulating the onset, growth
  and survival of rare, choroid plexus neoplasms remain poorly understood. Here, we
  examine the heterogeneity of human choroid plexus tumors by single-nucleus transcriptome
  analysis of 23,906 cells from four disease-free choroid plexus and eleven choroid
  plexus tumors. The resulting expression atlas profiles cellular and transcriptional
  diversity, copy number alterations, and cell-cell interaction networks in normal
