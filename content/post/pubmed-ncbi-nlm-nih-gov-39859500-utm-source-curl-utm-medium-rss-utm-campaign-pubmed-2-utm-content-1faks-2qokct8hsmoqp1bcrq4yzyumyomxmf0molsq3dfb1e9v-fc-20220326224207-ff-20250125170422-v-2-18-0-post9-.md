description: To identify the differences between aged and young human hematopoiesis,
  we performed a direct comparison of aged and young human hematopoietic stem and
  progenitor cells (HSPCs). Alterations in transcriptome profiles upon aging between
  humans and mice were then compared. Human specimens consist of CD34+ cells from
  bone marrow, and mouse specimens of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs; Lin- Kit+ Sca1+
  CD150+). Single-cell transcriptomic studies, functional clustering, and developmental
