description: To improve the understanding of the extraction chemistry of An(iii) and
  Ln(iii) with N-donor ligands 2,6-bis(5-(tert-butyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)pyridine (C4-BPP)
  in the presence of 2-bromohexanoic acid was investigated. Extraction studies showed
  an excellent separation factor of SF(Am(III)/Eu(III)) ≈ 200 and SF(Am(III)/Nd(III))
  ≈ 60 in comparison with the structurally similar ligand 2,6-bis(5-neopentyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)pyridine
  C5-BPP (SF(Am(III)/Eu(III)) ≈ 100), even though C5-BPP ...
