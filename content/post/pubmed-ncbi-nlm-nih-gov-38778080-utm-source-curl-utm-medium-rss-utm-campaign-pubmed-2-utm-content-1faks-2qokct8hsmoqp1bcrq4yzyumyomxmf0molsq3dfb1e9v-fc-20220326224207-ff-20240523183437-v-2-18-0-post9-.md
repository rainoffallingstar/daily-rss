description: The ABC and ACMG variant classification systems were compared by asking
  mainly European clinical laboratories to classify variants in 10 challenging cases
  using both systems, and to state if the variant in question would be reported as
  a relevant result or not as a measure of clinical utility. In contrast to the ABC
  system, the ACMG system was not made to guide variant reporting but to determine
  the likelihood of pathogenicity. Nevertheless, this comparison is justified since
