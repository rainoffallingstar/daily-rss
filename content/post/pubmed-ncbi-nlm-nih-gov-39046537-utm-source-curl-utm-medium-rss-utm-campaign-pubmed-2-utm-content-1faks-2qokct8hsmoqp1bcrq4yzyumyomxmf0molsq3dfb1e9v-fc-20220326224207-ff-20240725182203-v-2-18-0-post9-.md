description: 'CONCLUSIONS: HoLEP using the en-bloc technique is a safe and highly
  effective method. Over time, a slight but steady learning curve and improvement
  in operation time, enucleation efficiency and laser energy efficiency were shown
  even for an experienced surgeon - after 500 cases, still no plateau was reached.
  There was no measurable learning curve regarding blood loss, complications, length
  of hospital stay, and catheterization ...'
