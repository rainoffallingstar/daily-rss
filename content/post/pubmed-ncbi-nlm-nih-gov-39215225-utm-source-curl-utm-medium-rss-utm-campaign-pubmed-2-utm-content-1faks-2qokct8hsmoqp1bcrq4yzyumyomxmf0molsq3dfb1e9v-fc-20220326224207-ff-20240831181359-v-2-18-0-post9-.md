description: We describe an approach to access 4-aroyl-3-aryl-3,4-dihydronaphthalen-1(2H)-one
  derivatives in 41-79% yields through the Cu-catalyzed radical cyclization/desulfonylation
  of 1,6-enynes with tosylhydrazide under air conditions. This alternative desulfonylation
  strategy combines mild conditions, external oxidant-free processes, and sustainability,
  contributing to more environmentally friendly organic synthesis. The mechanistic
  studies showed that the CuCl/O(2) combination serves as the source ...
