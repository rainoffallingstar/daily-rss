description: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) risk prediction models based on Epstein-Barr
  virus (EBV)-antibody testing have shown potential for screening of NPC; however,
  the long-term stability is unclear. Here, we investigated the kinetics of two EBV-antibody
  NPC risk scores within the Taiwan NPC Multiplex Family Study. Among 545 participants
  with multiple blood samples, we evaluated the stability of a 2-marker enzyme-linked
  immunosorbent assay score and 13-marker multiplex serology score using ...
