description: We have previously shown that general deletion of the gene encoding the
  p53-inducible Mir34a microRNA enhances the number and invasion of colitis-associated
  colorectal cancers (CACs) in mice. Since the p53-pathway has been implicated in
  tumor-suppression mediated by cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) we deleted
  Mir34a in myeloid cells and characterized CACs in these with scRNA-Seq (single cell
  RNA sequencing). This revealed an increase in specific macrophage subtypes, such
  as ...
