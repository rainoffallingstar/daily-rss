description: The effects of gender affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) on bone microarchitecture
  and fracture risk in adult transgender women is unclear. To investigate the concept
  that skeletal integrity and strength in trans women may be improved by treatment
  with a higher dose of GAHT than commonly prescribed, we treated adult male mice
  with a sustained, high dose of estradiol. Adult male mice at 16 weeks of age were
  administered ~1.3 mg estradiol by silastic implant, implanted intraperitoneally,
