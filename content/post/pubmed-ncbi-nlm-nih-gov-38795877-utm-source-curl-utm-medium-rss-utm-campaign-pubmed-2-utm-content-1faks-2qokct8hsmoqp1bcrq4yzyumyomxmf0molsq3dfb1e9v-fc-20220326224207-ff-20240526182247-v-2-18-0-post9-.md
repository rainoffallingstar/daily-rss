description: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a severe neoplastic disease associated
  with high morbidity and mortality rates. HCC is often detected at advanced stages
  leading to ineffective curative treatments. Recently, liquid biopsy has emerged
  as a non-invasive method to identify highly specific HCC biomarkers in bodily fluids
  such as blood, serum, urine, and saliva. Circulating cell-free nucleic acids (cfNAs),
