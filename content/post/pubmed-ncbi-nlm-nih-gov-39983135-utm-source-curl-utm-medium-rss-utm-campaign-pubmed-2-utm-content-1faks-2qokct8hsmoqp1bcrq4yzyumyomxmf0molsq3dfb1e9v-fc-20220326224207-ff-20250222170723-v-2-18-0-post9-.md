description: We present new exclusion bounds obtained at the European X-Ray Free Electron
  Laser facility (EuXFEL) on axionlike particles in the mass range 10^{-3} eV≲m_{a}≲10^{4}
  eV. Our experiment exploits the Primakoff effect via which photons can, in the presence
  of a strong external electric field, decay into axions, which then convert back
  into photons after passing through an opaque wall. While similar searches have been
  performed previously at a third-generation synchrotron [Yamaji et al., Phys. ...
