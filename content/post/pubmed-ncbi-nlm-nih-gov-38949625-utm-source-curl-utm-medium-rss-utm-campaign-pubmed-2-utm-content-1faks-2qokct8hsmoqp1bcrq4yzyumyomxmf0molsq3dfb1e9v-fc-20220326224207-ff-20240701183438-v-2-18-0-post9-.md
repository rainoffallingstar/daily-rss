description: Photoinduced nonadiabatic processes play a crucial role in a wide range
  of disciplines, from fundamental steps in biology to modern applications in advanced
  materials science. A theoretical understanding of these processes is highly desirable,
  and trajectory surface hopping (TSH) has proven to be a well-suited framework for
  a wide range of systems. In this work, we present a comprehensive comparison between
  two TSH algorithms, the conventional Tully's fewest switches surface hopping ...
