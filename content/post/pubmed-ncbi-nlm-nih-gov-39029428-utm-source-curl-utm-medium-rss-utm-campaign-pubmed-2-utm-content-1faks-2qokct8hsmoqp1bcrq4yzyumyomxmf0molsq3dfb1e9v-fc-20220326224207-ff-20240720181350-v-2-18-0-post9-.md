description: The human transcriptome predominantly consists of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs),
  transcripts that do not encode proteins. The noncoding transcriptome governs a multitude
  of pathophysiological processes, offering a rich source of next-generation biomarkers.
  Toward achieving a holistic view of disease, the integration of these transcripts
  with clinical records and additional data from omic technologies ("multiomic" strategies)
  has motivated the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) approaches. ...
