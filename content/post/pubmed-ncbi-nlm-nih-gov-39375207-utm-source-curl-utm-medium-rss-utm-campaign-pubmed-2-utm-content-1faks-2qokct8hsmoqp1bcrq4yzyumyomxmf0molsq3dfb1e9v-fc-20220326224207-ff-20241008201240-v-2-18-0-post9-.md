description: Post-mortem studies have shown that patients dying from severe acute
  respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection frequently have pathological
  changes in their CNS, particularly in the brainstem. Many of these changes are proposed
  to result from para-infectious and/or post-infection immune responses. Clinical
  symptoms such as fatigue, breathlessness, and chest pain are frequently reported
  in post-hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. We propose that
