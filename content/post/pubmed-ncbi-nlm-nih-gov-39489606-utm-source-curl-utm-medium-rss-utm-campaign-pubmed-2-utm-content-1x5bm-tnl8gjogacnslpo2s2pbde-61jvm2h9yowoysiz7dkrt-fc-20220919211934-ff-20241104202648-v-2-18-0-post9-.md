  playing a pivotal role in understanding the mechanisms of pathogenesis, developing
  new drugs, and discovering novel drug targets. However, existing computational models
  for subcellular localization face significant challenges, such as reliance on known
  Gene Ontology (GO) annotation databases or overlooking the relationship between
  GO annotations and subcellular localization. To address these issues, we propose
