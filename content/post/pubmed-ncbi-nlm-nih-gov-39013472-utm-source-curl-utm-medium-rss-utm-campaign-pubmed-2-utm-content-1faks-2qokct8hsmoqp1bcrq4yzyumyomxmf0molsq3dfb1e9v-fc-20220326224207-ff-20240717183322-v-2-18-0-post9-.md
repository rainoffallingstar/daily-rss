description: Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with inflammatory bowel diseases
  (IBDs). To understand how microbial-metabolic circuits contribute to intestinal
  injury, we disrupt mitochondrial function in the epithelium by deleting the mitochondrial
  chaperone, heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60^(Δ/ΔIEC)). This metabolic perturbation causes
  self-resolving tissue injury. Regeneration is disrupted in the absence of the aryl
  hydrocarbon receptor (Hsp60^(Δ/ΔIEC);AhR^(-/-)) involved in intestinal homeostasis
