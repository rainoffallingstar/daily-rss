description: The replication organelle of hepatitis C virus (HCV), called membranous
  web, is derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mainly comprises double
  membrane vesicles (DMVs) that concentrate the viral replication complexes. It also
  tightly associates with lipid droplets (LDs), which are essential for virion morphogenesis.
  In particular acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), a rate-limiting
