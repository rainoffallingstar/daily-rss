description: We use one-photon excitation to promote K-shell electrons of formic acid
  (which has a planar equilibrium structure) to an antibonding π^{*} orbital. The
  excited molecule is known to have a (chiral) pyramidal equilibrium structure. In
  our experiment, we determine the handedness of the excited molecule by imaging the
  momenta of charged fragments, which occur after its Coulomb explosion triggered
  by Auger-Meitner decay cascades succeeding the excitation. We find that the handedness
  of the ...
