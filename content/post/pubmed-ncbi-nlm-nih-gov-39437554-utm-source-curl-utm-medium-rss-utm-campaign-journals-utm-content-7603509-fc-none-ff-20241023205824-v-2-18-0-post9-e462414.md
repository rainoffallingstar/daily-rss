description: Human saliva contains extracellular vesicles (EVs). These EVs expose
  extrinsic tenase complexes of tissue factor (TF) and activated factor VII (FVIIa),
  and trigger blood coagulation. Here, we show that EVs exposing extrinsic tenase
  complexes are also present in saliva of persons with severe hemophilia A, i.e. persons
  with FVIII deficiency. Addition of these salivary EVs to autologous FVIII-deficient
  blood results in FXa generation, thereby compensating for the lack of FXa generation
