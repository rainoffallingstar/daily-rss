description: IDH-mutant astrocytomas are diffuse gliomas that are defined by characteristic
  mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 and do not have complete 1p/19q co-deletion. The established
  grading criteria include histological features of brisk mitotic activity (grade
  3) and necrosis and/or microvascular proliferation (grade 4). In addition, homozygous
  deletion of the CDKN2A/B locus has recently been implemented as a molecular marker
  for grade 4 IDH-mutant astrocytomas. Here, we describe a subgroup of ...
