description: Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is the most abundant neuropeptide in the brain.
  It exerts anxiolytic and anticonvulsive actions, reduces stress and suppresses fear
  memory. While its effects at the behavioral and cellular levels have been well studied,
  much less is known about the modulation of physiological activity patterns at the
  network level. We therefore studied the impact of NPY on two prominent, memory-related
  hippocampal activity patterns, gamma oscillations and sharp wave-ripple complexes
