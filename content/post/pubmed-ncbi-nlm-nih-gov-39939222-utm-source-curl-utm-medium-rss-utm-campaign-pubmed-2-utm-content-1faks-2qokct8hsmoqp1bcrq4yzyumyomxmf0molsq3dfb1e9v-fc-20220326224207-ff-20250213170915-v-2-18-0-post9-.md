description: Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs), or myositis, are rare diseases
  marked by immune-driven muscle damage and complications like skin lesions and interstitial
  lung disease (ILD). Despite advances, challenges in diagnosis and treatment persist,
  particularly in inclusion body myositis (IBM), where no effective therapy exists.
  Recent breakthroughs, including transcriptomics and insights into antibody-mediated
  immunity and interferon (IFN) signaling, have clarified IIM pathophysiology ...
