description: Immune cell functionality is highly dependent on the actin cytoskeleton.
  The actin cytoskeleton is regulated by a complex molecular machinery, involving
  multiple genes. Mutations in these genes can cause inborn errors of immunity, also
  termed immunoactinopathies, of which Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome is the best-characterized
  entity. At present, mutations in 23 genes can be considered causative of immunoactinopathies.
  Immunoactinopathies are rare disease entities with complex combinations ...
