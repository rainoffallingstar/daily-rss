description: Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2a (PCH2a) is an ultra-rare, autosomal
  recessive pediatric disorder with limited treatment options. Its anatomical hallmark
  is hypoplasia of the cerebellum and pons accompanied by progressive microcephaly.
  A homozygous founder variant in TSEN54, which encodes a tRNA splicing endonuclease
  (TSEN) complex subunit, is causal. The pathological mechanism of PCH2a remains unknown
  due to the lack of a model system. Therefore, we developed human models of PCH2a
