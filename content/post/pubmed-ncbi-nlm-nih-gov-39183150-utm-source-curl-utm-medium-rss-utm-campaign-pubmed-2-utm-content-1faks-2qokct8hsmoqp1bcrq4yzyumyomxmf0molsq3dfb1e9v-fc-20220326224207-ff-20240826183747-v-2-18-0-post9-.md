description: Monogenic diseases are well-suited paradigms for the causal analysis
  of disease-driving molecular patterns. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is one such
  monogenic model caused by mutation or deletion of the Survival of motor neuron 1
  (SMN1) gene. Although several functions of the SMN protein have been studied, single
  functions and pathways alone do not allow to identify critical disease-driving molecules.
  Here, we analyzed the systemic characteristics of SMA employing proteomics, phosphoproteomics,...
