description: Spatial transcriptomics is an essential application for investigating
  cellular structures and interactions and requires multimodal information to precisely
  study spatial domains. Here, we propose STAIG, a deep-learning model that integrates
  gene expression, spatial coordinates, and histological images using graph-contrastive
  learning coupled with high-performance feature extraction. STAIG can integrate tissue
  slices without prealignment and remove batch effects. Moreover, it is designed ...
