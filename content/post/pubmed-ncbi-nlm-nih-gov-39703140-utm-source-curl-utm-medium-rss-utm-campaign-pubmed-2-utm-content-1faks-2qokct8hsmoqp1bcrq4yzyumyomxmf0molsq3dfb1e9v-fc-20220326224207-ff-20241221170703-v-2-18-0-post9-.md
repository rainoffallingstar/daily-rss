description: Osteoarthritis (OA), a joint disease, burdens global healthcare due to
  aging and obesity. Recent studies show that extracellular vesicles (EVs) from bone
  marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) contribute to joint homeostasis and
  OA management. However, the impact of donor age on BMSC-derived EV efficacy remains
  underexplored. In this study, we investigated EV efficacy from young BMSCs (2-month-old)
  in mitigating OA, contrasting them with EVs from aged BMSCs (27-month-old). The
