description: 'Background/Objectives: Traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) profoundly
  impacts patients by precipitating a loss of motor and sensory capabilities, largely
  due to oxidative stress and inflammation during the secondary injury phase. Methods:
  This investigation explores the diagnostic potential of zinc (Zn) and free zinc
  (fZn) as biomarkers by analyzing their serum concentration dynamics in 48 TSCI individuals
  with TSCI, with the aim of correlating these levels with neurological impairment.
