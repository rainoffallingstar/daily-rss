description: The rapid development of the digital healthcare and the electronic health
  records (EHR) requires smooth networking infrastructure to access data using Hypertext
  Transfer Protocol (HTTP)-based applications. The new HTTP/3 standard should provide
  performance and security improvements over HTTP/2. The goal of our work was to test
  the performance of HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 in the context of the EHRs. We used 45,000
  test FHIR Patient resources downloaded and uploaded using 20, 50, 100 and 200 resources
