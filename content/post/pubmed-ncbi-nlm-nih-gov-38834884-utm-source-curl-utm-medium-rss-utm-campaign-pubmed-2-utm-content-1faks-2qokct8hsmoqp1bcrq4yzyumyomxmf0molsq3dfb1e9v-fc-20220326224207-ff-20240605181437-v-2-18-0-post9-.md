description: Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is the most prevalent inflammatory muscle
  disease in older adults with no effective therapy available. In contrast to other
  inflammatory myopathies such as subacute, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM),
  IBM follows a chronic disease course with both inflammatory and degenerative features
  of pathology. Moreover, causal factors and molecular drivers of IBM progression
  are largely unknown. Therefore, we paired single-nucleus RNA sequencing with ...
