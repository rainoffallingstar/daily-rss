description: The peptide hormone glucagon is a fundamental metabolic regulator that
  is also being considered as a pharmacotherapeutic option for obesity and type 2
  diabetes. Despite this, we know very little regarding how glucagon exerts its pleiotropic
  metabolic actions. Given that the liver is a chief site of action, we performed
  in situ time-resolved liver phosphoproteomics to reveal glucagon signaling nodes.
  Through pathway analysis of the thousands of phosphopeptides identified, we reveal
