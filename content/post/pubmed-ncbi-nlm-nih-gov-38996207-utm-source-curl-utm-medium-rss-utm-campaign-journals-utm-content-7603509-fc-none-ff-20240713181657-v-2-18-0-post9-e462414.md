description: Coagulation factor IX plays a central role in hemostasis through interaction
  with factor VIIIa to form the factor X-activating complex at the site of injury.
  The absence of factor IX activity results in the bleeding disorder hemophilia B.
  This absence of activity can arise either from a lack of circulating factor IX protein
  or from mutations that decrease the activity of factor IX. This review focuses on
  analyzing the structure of factor IX with respect to molecular mechanisms that are
