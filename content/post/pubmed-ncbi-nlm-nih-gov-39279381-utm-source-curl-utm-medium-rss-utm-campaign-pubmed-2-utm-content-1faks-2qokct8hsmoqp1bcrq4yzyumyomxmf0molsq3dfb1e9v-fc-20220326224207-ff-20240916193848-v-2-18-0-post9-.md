description: It has been known that poor tumor perfusion and dysregulated cancer cell
  metabolism give rise to tumor microenvironments with unphysiologic nutrient levels,
  but the precise alterations in metabolite abundance are not well defined. In a 2015
  study in Cancer Research, Kamphorst and colleagues published a detailed comparison
  of the metabolome from human pancreatic tumors and benign tissues. Tumors were depleted
  in glucose and various nonessential amino acids but, surprisingly, enriched in ...
