description: Bridged triarylamines, so-called N-heterotriangulenes (N-HTAs) are promising
  organic semiconductors for applications in optoelectronic devices. Thereby the electronic
  structure at organic/metal interfaces and within thin films as well as the electronically
  excited states dynamics after optical excitation is essential for the performance
  of organic-molecule-based devices. Here, we investigated the energy level alignment
  and the excited state dynamics of a N-HTA derivative adsorbed on Au(111) ...
