description: T cells that recognize tumor-specific mutations are crucial for cancer
  immunosurveillance and in adoptive transfer of TILs or transgenic-TCR T cell products.
  However, their challenging identification and isolation limits their use in clinical
  practice. Therefore, novel approaches to isolate tumor-specific T cells are needed.
  Here, we report the isolation of neoantigen-specific CD8^(+) T cells from a vaccination
  site of a metastatic breast cancer patient who received a personalized vaccine.
