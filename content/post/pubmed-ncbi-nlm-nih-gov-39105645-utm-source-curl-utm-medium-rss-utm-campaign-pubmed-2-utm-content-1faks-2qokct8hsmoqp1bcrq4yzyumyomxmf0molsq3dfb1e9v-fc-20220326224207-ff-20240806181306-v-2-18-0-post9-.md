description: Background The combination of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) with mechanical
  thrombectomy (MT) may have clinical benefits for patients with medium vessel occlusion.
  Purpose To examine whether MT combined with IVT is associated with different outcomes
  than MT alone in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and medium vessel occlusion.
  Materials and Methods This retrospective study included consecutive adult patients
  with AIS and medium vessel occlusion treated with MT or MT with IVT at ...
