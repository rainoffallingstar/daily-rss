description: The overexpression of somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2) is a property
  of various tumor types. Hybrid imaging utilizing [^(68)Ga]1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetra-acetic
  acid (DOTA) may improve the differentiation between tumor and healthy tissue. We
  conducted an experimental study on 47 anonymized patient cases including 30 meningiomas,
  12 PitNET and 5 SBPGL. Four independent observers were instructed to contour the
  macroscopic tumor volume on planning MRI and then reassess ...
