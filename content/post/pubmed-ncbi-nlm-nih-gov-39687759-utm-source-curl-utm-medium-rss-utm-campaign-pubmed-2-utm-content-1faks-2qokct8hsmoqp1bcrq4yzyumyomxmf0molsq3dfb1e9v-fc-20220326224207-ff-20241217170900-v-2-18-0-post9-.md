description: While there is much knowledge about local neuronal circuitry, considerably
  less is known about how neuronal input is integrated and combined across neuronal
  networks to encode higher order brain functions. One challenge lies in the large
  number of complex neural interactions. Neural networks use oscillating activity
  for information exchange between distributed nodes. To better understand building
  principles underlying the observation of synchronized oscillatory activity in a
