description: This review demonstrates the value of central pharmacodynamics (PD),
  including positron emission tomography (PET) and computerized cognitive testing,
  to supplement pharmacokinetic (PK) and peripheral PD for determining the target
  dose range for clinical efficacy testing of emestedastat, an 11β-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase 1 (11β-HSD1) inhibitor. Combined data from 6 clinical trials in cognitively
  normal volunteers and patients with Alzheimer disease included a population PK model,
