  member of a conserved family of single-stranded RNA-binding proteins (IGF2BP1-3),
  is expressed in a broad range of fetal tissues, placenta and more than sixteen cancer
  types but only in a limited number of normal adult tissues. IGF2BP1is required for
  the transport from nucleus to cytoplasm of certain mRNAs that play essential roles
  in embryogenesis, carcinogenesis, and multidrug resistance (MDR), by affecting their
