description: Zosuquidar (LY335979) is a widely used experimental P-glycoprotein (P-gp)
  inhibitor, which is commended as very potent but also as very specific for P-gp.
  In this in vitro and in silico study, we demonstrated for the first time that zosuquidar
  also inhibits organic cation transporters (OCT) 1-3, albeit less potently than P-gp.
  This still has to be kept in mind when zosuquidar is used to inhibit cellular efflux
  of P-gp substrates that are concurrently transported into the cells by OCTs. To
