description: Abnormalities involving class I HLA are frequent in many lymphoma subtypes
  but have not yet been extensively studied in cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL).
  We characterized the occurrence of class I HLA abnormalities in 65 patients with
  advanced mycosis fungoides (MF) or Sézary syndrome (SS). Targeted DNA sequencing
  including coverage of HLA loci revealed at least one HLA abnormality in 26/65 patients
  (40%). Twelve unique somatic HLA mutations were identified across nine patients,
  and loss ...
