  CRC (mCRC) still have a dismal overall survival due to the frequent occurrence of
  acquired resistance mechanisms thereby leading to clinical relapse. Understanding
  molecular mechanisms that support acquired resistance to anti-EGFR targeted therapy
  in mCRC is therefore clinically relevant and key to improving patient outcomes.
