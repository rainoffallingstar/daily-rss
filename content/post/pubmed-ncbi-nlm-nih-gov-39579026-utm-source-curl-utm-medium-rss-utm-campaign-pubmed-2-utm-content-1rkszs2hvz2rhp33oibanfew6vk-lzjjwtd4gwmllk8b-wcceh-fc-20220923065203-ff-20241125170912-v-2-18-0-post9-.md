description: This study emphasizes the importance of early detection of osteonecrosis
  of the femoral head (ONFH) in young patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy,
  including those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lupus, and other diagnoses. While
  X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are standard imaging methods for staging
  ONFH, MRI can be costly and time-consuming. The research focuses on utilizing artificial
  intelligence (AI) to enhance the evaluation of radiographic images for ONFH ...
