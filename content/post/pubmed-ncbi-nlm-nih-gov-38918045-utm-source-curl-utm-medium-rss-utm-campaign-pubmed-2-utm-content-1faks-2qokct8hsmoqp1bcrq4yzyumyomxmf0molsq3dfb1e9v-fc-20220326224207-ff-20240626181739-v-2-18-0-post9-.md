description: Agreement to participate in case-control studies has become low. Healthy
  participant bias resulting from differential response proportions in cases and controls
  can distort results; however, the magnitude of bias is difficult to assess. We investigated
  the effect in a large population-based case-control study on breast cancer, with
  a participation rate of 43.4% and 64.1% for controls and cases. We performed a mortality
  follow-up in 2020 for 3,813 cases and 7,335 controls recruited ...
