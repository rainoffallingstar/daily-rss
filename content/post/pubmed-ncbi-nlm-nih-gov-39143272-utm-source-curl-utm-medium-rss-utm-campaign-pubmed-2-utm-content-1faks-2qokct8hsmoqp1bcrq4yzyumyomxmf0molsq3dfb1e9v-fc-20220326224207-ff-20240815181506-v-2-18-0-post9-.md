description: Despite major advances in molecular profiling and classification of primary
  brain tumors, personalized treatment remains limited for most patients. Here, we
  explored the feasibility of individual molecular profiling and the efficacy of biomarker-guided
  therapy for adult patients with primary brain cancers in the real-world setting
  within the molecular tumor board Freiburg, Germany. We analyzed genetic profiles,
  personalized treatment recommendations, and clinical outcomes of 102 patients with
