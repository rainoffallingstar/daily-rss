description: We present the second part of the rigorous evaluation of modern machine
  learning force fields (MLFFs) within the TEA Challenge 2023. This study provides
  an in-depth analysis of the performance of MACE, SO3krates, sGDML, SOAP/GAP, and
  FCHL19* in modeling molecules, molecule-surface interfaces, and periodic materials.
  We compare observables obtained from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using different
  MLFFs under identical conditions. Where applicable, density-functional theory (DFT)
