description: Ultra-high dose rate radiotherapy with electrons and protons has shown
  potential for cancer treatment by effectively targeting tumors while sparing healthy
  tissues (FLASH effect). This study aimed to investigate the potential FLASH sparing
  effect of ultra-high-dose rate helium ion irradiation, focusing on acute brain injury
  and subcutaneous tumor response in a preclinical in vivo setting. Raster-scanned
  helium ion beams were used to compare the effects of standard dose rate (SDR at
  0.2 Gy/s) ...
