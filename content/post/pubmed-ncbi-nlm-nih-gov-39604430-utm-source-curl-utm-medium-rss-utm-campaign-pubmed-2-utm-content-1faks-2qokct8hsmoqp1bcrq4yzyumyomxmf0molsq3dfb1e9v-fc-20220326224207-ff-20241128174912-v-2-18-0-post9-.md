description: Targeted (nano-)drug delivery is essential for treating respiratory diseases,
  which are often confined to distinct lung regions. However, spatio-temporal profiling
  of drugs or nanoparticles (NPs) and their interactions with lung macrophages remains
  unresolved. Here, we present LungVis 1.0, an AI-powered imaging ecosystem that integrates
  light sheet fluorescence microscopy with deep learning-based image analysis pipelines
  to map NP deposition and dosage holistically and quantitatively ...
