description: Knowledge about the underlying causes of the individual occurrence of
  symptoms during acute COVID-19 disease and during the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19
  is limited. In a German COVID-19 follow-up study, we assessed whether elevated antibody
  responses to herpesviruses were associated with symptom occurrence in acute COVID-19
  disease (n = 96 participants) and during 20 months of follow-up (n = 62 participants).
  Serum samples were analyzed for their antibodies to herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1
