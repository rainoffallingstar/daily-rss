description: Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is an autosomal-recessive disorder caused
  by pathogenic variants (PVs) of the ATM gene. Children with A-T are predisposed
  to hematological malignancies. We aimed to investigate their characteristics and
  outcomes in order to generate data-based treatment recommendations. In this multinational,
  observational study we report 202 patients aged ≤25 years with A-T and hematological
  malignancies from 25 countries. Ninety-one patients (45%) presented with mature
