description: Ultrasound (US) has gained popularity as a guidance modality for percutaneous
  needle insertions because it is widely available and non-ionizing. However, coordinating
  scanning and needle insertion still requires significant experience. Current assistance
  solutions utilize optical or electromagnetic tracking (EMT) technology directly
  integrated into the US device or probe. This results in specialized devices or introduces
  additional hardware, limiting the ergonomics of both the scanning ...
