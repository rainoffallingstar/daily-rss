description: 'This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the myelodysplasia-related
  gene (MRG) as well as additional gene mutations on outcomes in intensively treated
  patients with NPM1-mutated (NPM1 ^(mut)) AML. Targeted DNA sequencing of 263 genes
  was performed in 568 NPM1 ^(mut) AML patients (median age: 59 years) entered into
  the prospective AMLSG 09-09 treatment trial. Most commonly co-mutated genes were
  DNMT3A (49.8%), FLT3-TKD (25.9%), PTPN11 (24.8%), NRAS (22.7%), TET2 (21.7%), IDH2
  (21.3%), ...'
