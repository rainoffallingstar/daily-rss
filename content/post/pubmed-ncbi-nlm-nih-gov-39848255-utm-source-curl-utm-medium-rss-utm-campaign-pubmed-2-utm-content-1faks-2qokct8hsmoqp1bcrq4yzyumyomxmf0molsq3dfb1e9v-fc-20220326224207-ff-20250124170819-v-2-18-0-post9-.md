description: The need for effective early detection and optimal therapy monitoring
  of cardiovascular diseases as the leading cause of death has led to an adaptation
  of the guidelines with a focus on cardiac computed tomography (CCTA) in patients
  with a low to intermediate risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). In particular,
  the introduction of photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT) in CT diagnostics
  promises significant advances through higher temporal and spatial resolution, and
  also enables ...
