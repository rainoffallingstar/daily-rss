description: By using a limited-proteolysis strategy that employs a large amount of
  trypsin to generate peptides directly from native proteins, we found that ligand-induced
  protein local stability shifts can be sensitively detected on a proteome-wide scale.
  This enabled us to develop the peptide-centric local stability assay, a modification-free
  approach that achieves unprecedented sensitivity in proteome-wide target identification
  and binding-region determination. We demonstrate the broad applications ...
