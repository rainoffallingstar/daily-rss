description: Somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) are major mutations that contribute
  to the development and progression of various cancers. Despite a few computational
  methods proposed to detect CNAs from single-cell transcriptomic data, the technical
  sparsity of such data makes it challenging to identify allele-specific CNAs, particularly
  in complex clonal structures. In this study, we present a statistical method, XClone,
  that strengthens the signals of read depth and allelic imbalance by ...
