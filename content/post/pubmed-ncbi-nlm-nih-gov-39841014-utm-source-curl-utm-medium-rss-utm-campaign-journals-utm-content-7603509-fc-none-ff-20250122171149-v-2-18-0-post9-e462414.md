description: Platelets are crucial players in hemostasis and thrombosis, but also
  contribute to immune regulation and host defense, using different receptors, signaling
  pathways and effector functions, respectively. Whether distinct subsets of platelets
  specialize in these diverse tasks is insufficiently understood. Here, we employed
  an in vivo pulse-labelling method in Mus musculus models for tracking in vivo platelet
