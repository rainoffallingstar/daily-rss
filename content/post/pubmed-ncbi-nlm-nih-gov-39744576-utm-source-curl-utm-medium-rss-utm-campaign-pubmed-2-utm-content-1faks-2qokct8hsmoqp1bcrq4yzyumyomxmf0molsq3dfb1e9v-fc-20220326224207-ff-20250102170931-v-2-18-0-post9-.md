description: 'Background: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCC) is a rare malignant
  liver tumor with limited therapeutic advancements. Despite its increasing global
  incidence knowledge of treatment options remains stagnant, leading to poor five-year
  patient survival rates and high recurrence post-surgery. ALDH1A1, a member of the
  ALDH superfamily, is associated with cancer stem cells and has conflicting reports
  regarding its prognostic role in iCC. This retrospective study analyzed 69 iCC patient
