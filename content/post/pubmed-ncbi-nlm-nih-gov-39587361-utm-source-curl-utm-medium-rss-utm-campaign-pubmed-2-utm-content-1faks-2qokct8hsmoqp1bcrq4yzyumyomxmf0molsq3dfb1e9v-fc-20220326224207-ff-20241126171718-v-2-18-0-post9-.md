description: Chromosomal instability is a major driver of intratumoral heterogeneity
  (ITH), promoting tumor progression. In the present study, we combined structural
  variant discovery and nucleosome occupancy profiling with transcriptomic and immunophenotypic
  changes in single cells to study ITH in complex karyotype acute myeloid leukemia
  (CK-AML). We observed complex structural variant landscapes within individual cells
  of patients with CK-AML characterized by linear and circular breakage-fusion-bridge...
