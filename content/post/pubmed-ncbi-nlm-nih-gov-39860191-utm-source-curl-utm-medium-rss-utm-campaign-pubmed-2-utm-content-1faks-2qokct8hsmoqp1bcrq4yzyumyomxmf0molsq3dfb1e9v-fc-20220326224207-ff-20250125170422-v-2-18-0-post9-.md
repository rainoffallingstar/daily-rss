description: In a search for dyes photoactivatable with visible light, fluorenes with
  substituents at positions 2 and 7 were prepared, and their absorption and emission
  spectra were studied. In particular, the synthesis route to 9-diazofluorenes with
  2-(N,N-dialkylamino) and N-modified 7-(4-pyridyl) substituents was established.
  These compounds are initially non-fluorescent, undergo photolysis with UV or blue
  light, and-in non-polar media-provide orange- to red-emitting products with a large
