description: DNA-hypomethylating agents (HMAs) induce notable remission rates in AML/MDS
  patients with TP53 mutations; however, secondary resistance often develops rapidly.
  In the DECIDER trial (NCT00867672), elderly AML patients (also those with adverse
  genetics) randomized to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) added to decitabine (DEC)
  attained significantly delayed time-to-resistance. An 82-year-old patient with a
  non-disruptive, in-frame TP53 mutation (p.Cys238_Asn239delinsTyr, VAF 90%) and ...
