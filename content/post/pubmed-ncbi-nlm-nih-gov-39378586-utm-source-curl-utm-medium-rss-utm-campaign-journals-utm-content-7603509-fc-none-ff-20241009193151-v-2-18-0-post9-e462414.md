description: Cellular metabolism is highly dynamic during hematopoiesis, yet the regulatory
  networks that maintain metabolic homeostasis during differentiation are incompletely
  understood. Here, we have studied the grave immunodeficiency syndrome reticular
  dysgenesis caused by loss of mitochondrial adenylate kinase 2 (AK2) function. By
