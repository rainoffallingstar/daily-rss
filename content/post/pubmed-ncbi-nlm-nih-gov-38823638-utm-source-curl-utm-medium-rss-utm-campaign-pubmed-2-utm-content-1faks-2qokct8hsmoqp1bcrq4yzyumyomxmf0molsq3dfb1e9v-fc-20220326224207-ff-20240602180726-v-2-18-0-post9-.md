description: Adaptive immune responses comprise the activation of T cells by peptide
  antigens that are presented by proteins of the Major Histocompatibility Complex
  (MHC) on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell (APC). As a consequence of the
  T cell receptor (TCR) interacting productively with a certain peptide-MHC complex,
  a specialized cell-cell junction, the immunological synapse, forms and is accompanied
  by changes in the spatiotemporal patterning and function of intracellular signaling
