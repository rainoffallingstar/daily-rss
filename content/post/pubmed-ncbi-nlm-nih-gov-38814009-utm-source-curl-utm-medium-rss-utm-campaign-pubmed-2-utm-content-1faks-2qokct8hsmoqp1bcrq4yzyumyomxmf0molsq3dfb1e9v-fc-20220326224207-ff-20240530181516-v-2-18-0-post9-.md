description: The folding of RNA and DNA strands plays crucial roles in biological
  systems and bionanotechnology. However, studying these processes with high-resolution
  numerical models is beyond current computational capabilities due to the timescales
  and system sizes involved. In this article, we present a new coarse-grained model
  for investigating the folding dynamics of nucleic acids. Our model represents three
  nucleotides with a patchy particle and is parameterized using well-established ...
