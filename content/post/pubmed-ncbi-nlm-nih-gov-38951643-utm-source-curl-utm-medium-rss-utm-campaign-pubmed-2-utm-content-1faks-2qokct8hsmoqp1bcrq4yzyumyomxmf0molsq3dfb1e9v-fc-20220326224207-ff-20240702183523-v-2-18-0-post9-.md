description: Pubertal timing varies considerably and is associated with later health
  outcomes. We performed multi-ancestry genetic analyses on ~800,000 women, identifying
  1,080 signals for age at menarche. Collectively, these explained 11% of trait variance
  in an independent sample. Women at the top and bottom 1% of polygenic risk exhibited
  ~11 and ~14-fold higher risks of delayed and precocious puberty, respectively. We
  identified several genes harboring rare loss-of-function variants in ~200,000 ...
