description: Bispidines are extremely rigid ligands, easy to prepare in a large variety,
  with denticities of four to ten, various donor sets and charges, for mono- and oligonuclear
  transition metal, main group and rare earth complexes. In the last approx. 20 years
  significantly more than 50 new bispidine based ligands were prepared and their coordination
  chemistry studied. Biological probes and medicinal applications is one main area
  in bispidine coordination chemistry, where fast complex formation, ...
