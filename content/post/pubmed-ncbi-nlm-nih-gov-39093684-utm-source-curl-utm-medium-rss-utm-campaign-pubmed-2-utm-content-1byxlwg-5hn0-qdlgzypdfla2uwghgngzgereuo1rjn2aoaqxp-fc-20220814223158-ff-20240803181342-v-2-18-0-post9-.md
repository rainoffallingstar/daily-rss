description: Deformable image registration is one of the essential processes in analyzing
  medical images. In particular, when diagnosing abdominal diseases such as hepatic
  cancer and lymphoma, multi-domain images scanned from different modalities or different
  imaging protocols are often used. However, they are not aligned due to scanning
  times, patient breathing, movement, etc. Although recent learning-based approaches
  can provide deformations in real-time with high performance, multi-domain abdominal
