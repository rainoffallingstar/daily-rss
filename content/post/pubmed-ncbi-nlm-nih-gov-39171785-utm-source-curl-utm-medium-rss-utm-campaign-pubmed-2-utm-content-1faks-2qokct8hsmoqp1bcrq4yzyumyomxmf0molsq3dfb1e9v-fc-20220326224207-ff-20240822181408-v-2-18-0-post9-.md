description: Anilines are ubiquitous in bio-active compounds and their synthesis can
  be achieved via metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions involving aryl halides.
  We describe an unusual, yet simple, CuII-catalyzed system for the amination of aryl
  chlorides in pure aqueous ammonia with 2.5 mol% catalyst loading under non-inert
  conditions. Different from previous systems, the reaction proceeds even without
  an additional organic solvent. Copper(II) sulfate in combination ...
