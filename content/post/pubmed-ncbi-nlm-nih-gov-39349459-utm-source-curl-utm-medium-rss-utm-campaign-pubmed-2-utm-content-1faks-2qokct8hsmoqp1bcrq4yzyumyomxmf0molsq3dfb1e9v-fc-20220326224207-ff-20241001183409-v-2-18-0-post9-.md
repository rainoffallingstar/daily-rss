description: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified natural killer (NK) cells show
  antileukemic activity against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in vivo. However, NK
  cell-mediated tumor killing is often impaired by the interaction between human leukocyte
  antigen (HLA)-E and the inhibitory receptor, NKG2A. Here, we describe a strategy
  that overcomes CAR-NK cell inhibition mediated by the HLA-E-NKG2A immune checkpoint.
  We generate CD33-specific, AML-targeted CAR-NK cells (CAR33) combined with ...
