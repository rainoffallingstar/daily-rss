description: Ewing sarcoma (EWS) is the second most common bone tumor affecting children
  and young adults, with dismal outcomes for patients with metastasis at diagnosis.
  Mechanisms leading to metastasis remain poorly understood. To deepen our knowledge
  on EWS progression, we have profiled tumors and metastases from a spontaneous metastasis
  mouse model using a multi-omics approach. Combining transcriptomics, proteomics,
  and methylomics analyses, we identified signaling cascades and candidate genes ...
