description: DNA methylation signatures ("episignatures") can be used as biomarkers
  of genetic aberrations, clinical phenotypes, and environmental exposures in rare
  diseases. Episignatures are utilized in molecular diagnostics and can clarify variants
  of uncertain significance. A growing number of disease genes, including epilepsy
  genes, exhibit robust and reproducible episignatures. However, whether SCN1A, the
  most prominent epilepsy gene, has one or more episignatures has not yet been determined.
