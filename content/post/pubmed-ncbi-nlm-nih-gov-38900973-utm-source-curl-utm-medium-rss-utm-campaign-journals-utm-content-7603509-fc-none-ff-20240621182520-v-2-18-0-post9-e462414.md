description: A common feature in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is
  the formation of a nonocclusive intraluminal thrombus (ILT) in regions of aortic
  dilation. Platelets are known to maintain hemostasis and propagate thrombosis through
  several redundant activation mechanisms, yet the role of platelet activation in
  the pathogenesis of AAA associated ILT is still poorly understood. Thus, we sought
  to investigate how platelet activation impacts the pathogenesis of AAA. Using RNA-sequencing,
