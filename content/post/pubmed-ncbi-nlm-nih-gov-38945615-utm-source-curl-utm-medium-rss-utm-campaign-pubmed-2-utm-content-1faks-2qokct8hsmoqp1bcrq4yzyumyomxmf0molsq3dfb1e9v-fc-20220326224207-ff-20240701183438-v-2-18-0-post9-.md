description: Lipids from cow milk fat globule membranes (MFGMs) and extracellular
  vesicles (EVs) are considered beneficial for neurodevelopment, cognitive maintenance
  and human health in general. Nevertheless, it is largely unknown whether intake
  of infant formulas and medical nutrition products rich in these particles promote
  accretion of specific lipids and whether this affects metabolic homeostasis. To
  address this, we carried out a 16-week dietary intervention study where mice were
