description: The class-II transactivator (CIITA) is the master regulator of MHC class-II
  gene expression and hence the adaptive immune response. Three cell type-specific
  promoters (pI, pIII, and pIV) are involved in the regulation of CIITA expression,
  which can be induced by IFN-γ in non-immune cells. While key regulatory elements
  have been identified within these promoters, our understanding of the transcription
  factors regulating CIITA expression is incomplete. Here, we demonstrate that ...
