description: Hypoglycemia triggers autonomic and endocrine counter-regulatory responses
  to restore glucose homeostasis, a response that is impaired in patients with diabetes
  and its long-term complication hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF).
  We show that insulin-evoked hypoglycemia is severely aggravated in mice lacking
  the cation channel proteins TRPC1, TRPC4, TRPC5, and TRPC6, which cannot be explained
  by alterations in glucagon or glucocorticoid action. By using various TRPC compound
