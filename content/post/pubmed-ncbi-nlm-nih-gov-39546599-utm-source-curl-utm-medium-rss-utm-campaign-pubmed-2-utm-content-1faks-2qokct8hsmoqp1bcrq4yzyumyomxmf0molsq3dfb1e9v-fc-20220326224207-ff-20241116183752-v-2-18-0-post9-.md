description: Maternal education was strongly correlated with adolescent brain morphology,
  cognitive performances, and mental health. However, the molecular basis for the
  effects of maternal education on the structural neurodevelopment remains unknown.
  Here, we conducted gene-environment-wide interaction study using the Adolescent
