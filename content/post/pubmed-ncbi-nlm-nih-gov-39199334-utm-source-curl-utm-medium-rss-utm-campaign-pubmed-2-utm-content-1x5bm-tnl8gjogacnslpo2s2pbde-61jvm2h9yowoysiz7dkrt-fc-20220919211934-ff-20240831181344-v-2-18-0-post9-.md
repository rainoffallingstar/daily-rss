description: The interaction between microbes and drugs encompasses the sourcing of
  pharmaceutical compounds, microbial drug degradation, the development of drug resistance
  genes, and the impact of microbial communities on host drug metabolism and immune
  modulation. These interactions significantly impact drug efficacy and the evolution
  of drug resistance. In this study, we propose a novel predictive model, termed GCGACNN.
  We first collected microbe, disease, and drug association data from multiple ...
