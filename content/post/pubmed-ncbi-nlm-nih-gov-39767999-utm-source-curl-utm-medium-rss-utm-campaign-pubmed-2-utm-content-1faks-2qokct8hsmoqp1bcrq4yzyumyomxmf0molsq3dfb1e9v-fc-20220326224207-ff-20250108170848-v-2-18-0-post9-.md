description: Thyroid eye disease (TED) is a common extrathyroidal manifestation of
  hyperthyroidism, typically associated with Graves' disease (GD). This condition
  can cause severe functional limitations as well as significant aesthetic concerns.
  Treatment for TED patients aims to restore functionality and address aesthetic concerns.
  Surgical TED treatment is usually performed by orbital wall resection, which effectively
  decompresses intraorbital tissues and corrects the orbital/ocular disorders. ...
