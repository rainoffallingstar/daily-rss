description: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a complex disease with advanced presentation
  that significantly affects survival rates. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies
  are needed. In this study, we investigate the tumor microenvironment (TME) in HCC
  by analyzing 13 HCC samples at single cell level. We identified key cell populations,
  including CD8 + T cells, Tregs, M1/M2 macrophages, and CD4 + memory T cells, and
  explored their roles and interactions. Our research revealed an early enrichment
  of CD8 ...
