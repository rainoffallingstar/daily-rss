description: 'OBJECTIVES: Purine-rich element-binding protein alpha (PURA) regulates
  gene expression and is ubiquitously expressed with an enrichment in neural tissues.
  Pathogenic variants in PURA cause the neurodevelopmental disorder PURA syndrome
  that has a variable phenotype but typically comprises moderate-to-severe global
  developmental delay, intellectual disability, early-onset hypotonia and hypothermia,
  epilepsy, feeding difficulties, movement disorders, and subtle facial dysmorphism.
