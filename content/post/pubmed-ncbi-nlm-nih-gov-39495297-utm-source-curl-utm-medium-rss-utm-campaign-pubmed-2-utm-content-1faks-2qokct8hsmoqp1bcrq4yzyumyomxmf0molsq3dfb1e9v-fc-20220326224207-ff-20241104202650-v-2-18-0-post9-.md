description: Known risk loci for endometrial cancer explain approximately one third
  of familial endometrial cancer. However, the association of germline copy number
  variants (CNVs) with endometrial cancer risk remains relatively unknown. We conducted
  a genome-wide analysis of rare CNVs overlapping gene regions in 4115 endometrial
  cancer cases and 17,818 controls to identify functionally relevant variants associated
  with disease. We identified a 1.22-fold greater number of CNVs in DNA samples from
