description: Single-cell sequencing has characterized cell state heterogeneity across
  diverse healthy and malignant tissues. However, the plasticity or heritability of
  these cell states remains largely unknown. To address this, we introduce PATH (phylogenetic
  analysis of trait heritability), a framework to quantify cell state heritability
  versus plasticity and infer cell state transition and proliferation dynamics from
  single-cell lineage tracing data. Applying PATH to a mouse model of pancreatic cancer,
