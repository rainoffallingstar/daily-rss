description: Bispecific antibodies (BsAb) have emerged as a leading treatment modality
  in patients suffering from B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL). However, treatment
  failure is common and may potentially be attributed to pre-existing or emerging
  T-cell exhaustion. CD39 catalyzes-together with CD73-the hydrolysis of immunogenic
  ATP into immunosuppressive adenosine and thus actively promotes an immunosuppressive
  micromilieu. Previously, we and others demonstrated that CD39^(+) T-cell subsets
  may have ...
