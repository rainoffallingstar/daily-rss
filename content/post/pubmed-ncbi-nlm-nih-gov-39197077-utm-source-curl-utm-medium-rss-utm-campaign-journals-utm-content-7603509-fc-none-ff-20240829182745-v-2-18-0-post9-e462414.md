description: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication in patients with
  brain tumors. The management of acute VTE is particularly challenging due to an
  elevated risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Risk for developing ICH on anticoagulation
  is influenced by a number of factors including tumor type, recent surgery, concomitant
  medications, platelet counts, and radiographic features. In patients with a heightened
