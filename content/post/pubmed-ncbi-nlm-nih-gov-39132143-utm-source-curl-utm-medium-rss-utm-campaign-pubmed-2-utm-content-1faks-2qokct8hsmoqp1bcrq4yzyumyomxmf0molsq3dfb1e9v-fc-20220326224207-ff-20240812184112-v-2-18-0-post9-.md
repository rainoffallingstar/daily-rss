  and plays a crucial role in global climate stability. It is one of the most important
  nutrient cycles in high-altitude lakes. The biogeochemistry of nitrogen is almost
  entirely dependent on redox reactions mediated by microorganisms. However, the nitrogen
  cycling of microbial communities in the high-altitude saline lakes of the Qinghai-Tibet
  Plateau (QTP), the world's "third pole" has not been investigated extensively. ...
