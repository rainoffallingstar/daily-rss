description: We present a computational scheme for predicting the ligands that bind
  to a pocket of a known structure. It is based on the generation of a general abstract
  representation of the molecules, which is invariant to rotations, translations,
  and permutations of atoms, and has some degree of isometry with the space of conformations.
  We use these representations to train a nondeep machine learning algorithm to classify
  the binding between pockets and molecule pairs and show that this approach has ...
