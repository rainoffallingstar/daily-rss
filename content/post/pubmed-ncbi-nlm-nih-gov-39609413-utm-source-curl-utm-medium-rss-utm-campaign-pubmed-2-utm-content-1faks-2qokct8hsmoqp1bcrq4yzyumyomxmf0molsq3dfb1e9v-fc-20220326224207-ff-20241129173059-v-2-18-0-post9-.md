description: Aberrant translation causes ribosome stalling, which leads to the ubiquitination
  of ribosomal proteins and induces ribosome-associated quality control. As part of
  this quality control process, the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF10 monoubiquitinates ribosomal
  protein RPS3. Here, we demonstrate that RNF10-mediated RPS3 monoubiquitination antagonizes
  ribosomal half-mer formation by promoting dissociation of 40S subunits from ribosomes
  stalled during translation elongation. Interestingly, RNF10 ...
