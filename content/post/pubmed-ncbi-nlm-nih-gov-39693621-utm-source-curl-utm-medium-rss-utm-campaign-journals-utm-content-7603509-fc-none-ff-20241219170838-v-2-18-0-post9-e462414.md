description: Coagulation is related to inflammation, but the key pathway, especially
  innate immune system and coagulation regulation, is not well understood and need
  to be further explored. Here, we demonstrated that neutrophil gelatinase-associated
  lipocalin (NGAL), an innate immune inflammatory mediator, is upregulated in thrombosis
  patients. Furthermore, it contributes to the initiation and amplification of coagulation,
  hemostasis, and thrombosis. This occurs by enhancing tissue factor expression on
