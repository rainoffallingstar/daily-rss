description: We report on the synthesis of two fluorescent probes which can be activated
  by β-Galactosidase (β-Gal) enzymes and/or light. The probes contained 2-nitro-4-oxybenzyl
  and 3-nitro-4-oxybenzyl fragments, with β-Gal residues linked to C-4. We performed
  the enzymatic and photoactivation of the probes in a cuvette and compared them,
  prior to the labeling of Vimentin-Halo fusion protein in live cells with overexpressed
  β-galactosidase. The dye fluorescence afforded the observation of enzyme activity
