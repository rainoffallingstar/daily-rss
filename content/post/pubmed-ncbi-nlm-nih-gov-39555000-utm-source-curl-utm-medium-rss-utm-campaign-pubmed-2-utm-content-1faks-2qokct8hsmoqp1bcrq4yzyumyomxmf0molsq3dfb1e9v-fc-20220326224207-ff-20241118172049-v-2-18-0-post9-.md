  manoeuvres that reflect health care workers'' physical movements during the delivery

  for each manoeuvre with only the cumulative results being provided. This finding
  raises the need to understand potential risk from a mask leak during the delivery
  of clinical care as evidenced by failing a manoeuvre during mask fit testing. Further
