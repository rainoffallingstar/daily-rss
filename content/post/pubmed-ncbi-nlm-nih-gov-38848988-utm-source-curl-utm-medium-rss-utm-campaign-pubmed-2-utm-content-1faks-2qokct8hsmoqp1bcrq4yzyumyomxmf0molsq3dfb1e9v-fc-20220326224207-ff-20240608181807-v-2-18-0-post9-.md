description: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) interact reciprocally with tumor
  cells through various signaling pathways in many cancer types including cutaneous
  squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). Among normal fibroblast (NF) subtypes, papillary
  fibroblasts (PFs) and reticular fibroblasts (RFs) respond distinctly to tumor cell
  signaling, eventuating the differentiation of RFs, rather than PFs, into CAFs. The
  regulation of subtype differentiation in fibroblasts remains poorly explored. In
  this study, ...
