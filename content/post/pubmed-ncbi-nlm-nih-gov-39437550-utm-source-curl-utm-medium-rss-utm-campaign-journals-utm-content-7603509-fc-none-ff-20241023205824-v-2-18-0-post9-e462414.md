description: The transcription factor IKZF1 is essential for B cell development, and
  recurrently mutated in human B-ALL. IKZF1 has been ascribed both activating and
  repressive functions via interactions with coactivator and corepressor complexes,
  but the relative abundance of IKZF1-associated coregulators and their contribution
  to IKZF1-mediated gene regulation are not well understood. To address this, we performed
