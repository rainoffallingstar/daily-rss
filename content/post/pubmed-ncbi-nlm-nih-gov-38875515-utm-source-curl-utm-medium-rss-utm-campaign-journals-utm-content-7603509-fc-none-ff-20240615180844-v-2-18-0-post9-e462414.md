description: The promising results obtained with immunotherapeutic approaches for
  multiple myeloma (MM) call for a better stratification of patients based on immune
  components. The most pressing being cytotoxic lymphocytes such as Natural Killer
  (NK) cells that are mandatory for MM surveillance and therapy. In this study, we
