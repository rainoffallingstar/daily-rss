description: Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of global mortality and presents
  a significant barrier to improving life expectancy. The primary objective of this
  study was to discern a unique differentially expressed gene (DEG) that exhibits
  a strong association with colorectal cancer. By achieving this goal, the research
  aims to contribute valuable insights to the field of translational medicine. We
  performed analysis of colorectal cancer microarray and the TCGA colon adenoma carcinoma
  (COAD) datasets ...
