description: Targeting AML by chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-T) is challenging
  due to the promiscuous expression of AML-associated antigens in healthy hematopoiesis
  and high degree of inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity. Here, we present single-cell
  expression data of AML-associated antigens in 30 primary pediatric AML samples.
  We identified CD33, CD38, CD371, IL1RAP and CD123 as the most frequently expressed.
  Notably, high variability was observed not only across the different patient samples
