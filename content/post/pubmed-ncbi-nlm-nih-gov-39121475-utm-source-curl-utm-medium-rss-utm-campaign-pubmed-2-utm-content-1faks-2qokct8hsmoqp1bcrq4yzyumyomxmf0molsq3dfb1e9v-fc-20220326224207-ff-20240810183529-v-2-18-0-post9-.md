description: Objective. Myocardial fibrosis is a devastating condition causing millions
  of deaths yearly. Several factors, such as aging, cause myocardial fibrosis. The
  Wnt/β-catenin pathway is one of the critical intracellular signaling for the development
  of cardiac fibrosis. Molecular and cellular mechanism of myocardial fibrosis induced
  by intensive exercise is not well-understood. The current study evaluates the effects
  of short- and long-term intensive exercise on the Wnt1 gene expression in a ...
