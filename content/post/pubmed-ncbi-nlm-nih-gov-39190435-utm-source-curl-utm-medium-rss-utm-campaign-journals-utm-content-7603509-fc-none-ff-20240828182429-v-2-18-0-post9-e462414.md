description: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a hyperinflammatory disorder
  driven by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). Emapalumab, an anti-IFN-γ antibody, is approved
  for the treatment of patients with primary HLH. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  (HSCT) is required for cure of HLH. Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) HSCT is
  associated with improved survival but higher incidences of mixed chimerism and secondary
  graft failure. To understand the potential impact of emapalumab on post-HSCT ...
