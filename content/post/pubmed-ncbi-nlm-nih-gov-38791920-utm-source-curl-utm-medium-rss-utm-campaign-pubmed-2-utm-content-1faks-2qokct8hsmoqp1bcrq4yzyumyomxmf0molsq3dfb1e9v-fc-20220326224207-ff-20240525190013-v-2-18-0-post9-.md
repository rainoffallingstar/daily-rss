description: The standard treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer typically
  includes concomitant chemoradiation, a regimen known to induce severe hematologic
  toxicity (HT). Particularly, pelvic bone marrow dose exposure has been identified
  as a contributing factor to this hematologic toxicity. Chemotherapy further increases
  bone marrow suppression, often necessitating treatment interruptions or dose reductions.
