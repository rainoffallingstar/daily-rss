description: Although the separate effects of water and nitrogen (N) limitations on
  forest growth are well known, the question of how to predict their combined effects
  remains a challenge for modeling of climate change impacts on forests. Here, we
  address this challenge by developing a new eco-physiological model that accounts
  for plasticity in stomatal conductance and leaf N concentration. Based on optimality
  principle, our model determines stomatal conductance and leaf N concentration by
  balancing ...
