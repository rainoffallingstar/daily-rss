description: In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), leukemia stem and progenitor cells (LSCs
  and LPCs) interact with various cell types in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment,
  regulating their expansion and differentiation. To study the interaction of CD4+
  and CD8+ T-cells in the BM with LSCs and LPCs, we analyzed their transcriptome and
  predicted cell-cell interactions by unbiased high-throughput correlation network
  analysis. We found that CD4+ T-cells in the BM of AML patients were activated and
  skewed ...
