description: Novel fused phenazines were synthesized through a combination of gold-catalyzed
  hydroamination and cascade cyclization reactions towards azaacenes. In total, 30
  new compounds were synthesized and investigated with respect to their structural
  and optoelectronic properties. In solution, these targets exhibit strong green to
  red emission, with quantum yields of up to 60%. The emission wavelength can be finely
  adjusted by the choice of solvent due to their solvatochromic behavior, as ...
