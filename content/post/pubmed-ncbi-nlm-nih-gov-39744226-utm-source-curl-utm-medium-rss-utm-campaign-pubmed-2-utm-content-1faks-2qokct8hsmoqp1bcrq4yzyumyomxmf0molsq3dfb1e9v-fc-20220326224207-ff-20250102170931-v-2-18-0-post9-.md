  (MI) and cardiac fibrosis is a major driver of the growing burden of heart failure.
  A non-invasive targeting method for activated cardiac fibroblasts would be advantageous
  because of their importance for imaging and therapy. Methods: Targeting was achieved
  by linking a 7-amino acid peptide (EP9) to a perfluorocarbon-containing nanoemulsion
  (PFC-NE) for visualization by ^(19)F-combined with ¹H-MRI. In vivo and ex ...'
