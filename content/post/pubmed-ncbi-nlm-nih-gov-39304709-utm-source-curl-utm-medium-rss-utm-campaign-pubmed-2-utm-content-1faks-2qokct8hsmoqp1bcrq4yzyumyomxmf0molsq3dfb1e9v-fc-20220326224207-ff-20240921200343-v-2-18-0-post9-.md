description: Most clinical information is encoded as free text, not accessible for
  quantitative analysis. This study presents an open-source pipeline using the local
  large language model (LLM) "Llama 2" to extract quantitative information from clinical
  text and evaluates its performance in identifying features of decompensated liver
  cirrhosis. The LLM identified five key clinical features in a zero- and one-shot
  manner from 500 patient medical histories in the MIMIC IV dataset. We compared LLMs
