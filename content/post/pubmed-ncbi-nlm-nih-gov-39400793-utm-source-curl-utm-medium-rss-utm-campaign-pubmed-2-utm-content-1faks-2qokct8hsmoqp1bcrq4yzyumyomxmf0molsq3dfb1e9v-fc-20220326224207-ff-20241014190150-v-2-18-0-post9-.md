description: On the occasion of ISOTT's half-century, in this chapter, tumour hypoxia
  (i.e. critically reduced oxygen levels on macro- and microscopic scales), recently
  classified as an additional hallmark of cancer, its various aetiology-related classifications
  (diffusion- or perfusion-limitations, hypoxaemic), time-frames of exposure (acute,
  chronic, cyclic), and different levels (moderate, mild, severe) within and across
  tumours, and its Janus-face-like role ("dichotomy") in tumour regression ...
