description: Myocardial infarction initiates cardiac remodeling and is central to
  heart failure pathogenesis. Following myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, monocytes
  enter the heart and differentiate into diverse subpopulations of macrophages. Here
  we show that deletion of Hif1α, a hypoxia response transcription factor, in resident
  cardiac macrophages led to increased remodeling and overrepresentation of macrophages
  expressing arginase 1 (Arg1). Arg1^(+) macrophages displayed an inflammatory ...
