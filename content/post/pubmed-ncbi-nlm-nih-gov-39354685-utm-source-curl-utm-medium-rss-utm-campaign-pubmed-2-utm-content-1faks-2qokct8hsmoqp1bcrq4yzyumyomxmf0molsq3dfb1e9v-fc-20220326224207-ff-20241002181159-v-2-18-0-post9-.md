description: A 64-year-old woman with meningioma presented with left-sided lenticulostriatal
  ischemia following craniotomy and debulking of a sphenoid wing meningioma. For subsequent
  radiotherapy planning, an SSTR-targeted PET/CT using the novel ligand 18F-SiTATE
  was performed 2.5 months thereafter. The meningioma remnants showed transosseous,
  intrasellar, and perivascular extension around the internal carotid artery with
  strong SSTR expression. Moreover, there was focal 18F-SiTATE uptake in the left
