description: Pathological cardiac remodeling predisposes individuals to developing
  heart failure. Here, we investigated two co-regulated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs),
  termed Gadlor1 and Gadlor2, which are upregulated in failing hearts of patients
  and mice. Cardiac overexpression of Gadlor1 and Gadlor2 aggravated myocardial dysfunction
  and enhanced hypertrophic and fibrotic remodeling in mice exposed to pressure overload.
  Compound Gadlor1/2 knockout (KO) mice showed markedly reduced myocardial ...
