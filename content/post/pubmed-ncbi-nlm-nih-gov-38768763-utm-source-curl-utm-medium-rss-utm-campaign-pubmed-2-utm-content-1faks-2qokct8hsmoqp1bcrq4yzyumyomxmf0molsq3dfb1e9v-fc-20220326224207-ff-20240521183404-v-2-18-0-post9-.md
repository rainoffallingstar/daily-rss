description: Heart failure (HF) prevalence is rising due to reduced early mortality
  and demographic change. Relaxin (RLN) mediates protective effects in the cardiovascular
  system through Relaxin-receptor 1 (RXFP1). Cardiac overexpression of RXFP1 with
  additional RLN supplementation attenuated HF in the pressure-overload transverse
