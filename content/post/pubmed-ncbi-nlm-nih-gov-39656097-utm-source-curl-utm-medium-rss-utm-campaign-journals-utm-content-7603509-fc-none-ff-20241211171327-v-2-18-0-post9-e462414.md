description: Anemia of Inflammation is a prevalent co-morbidity in patients with chronic
  inflammatory disorders. Inflammation causes hypoferremia and iron-restricted erythropoiesis
  by limiting Ferroportin (FPN)-mediated iron export from macrophages that recycle
  senescent erythrocytes. Macrophage cell surface expression of FPN is reduced by
  hepcidin-induced degradation and/or by repression of FPN (Slc40a1) transcription
  via cytokine and Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation. While the mechanisms ...
