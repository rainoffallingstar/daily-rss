description: The advancement of disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) for Alzheimer's
  disease (AD), along with the approval of three amyloid-targeting therapies in the
  US and several other countries, represents a significant development in the treatment
  landscape, offering new hope for addressing this once untreatable chronic progressive
  disease. However, significant challenges persist that could impede the successful
  integration of this class of drugs into clinical practice. These challenges ...
