description: Fast modulation of optical signals that carry multidimensional information
  in the form of wavelength, phase or polarization has fueled an explosion of interest
  in integrated photonics. This interest however masks a significant challenge which
  is that independent modulation of multi-wavelength carrier signals in a single waveguide
  is not trivial. Such challenge is attributed to the longitudinal direction of guided-mode
  propagation, limiting the spatial separation and modulation of ...
