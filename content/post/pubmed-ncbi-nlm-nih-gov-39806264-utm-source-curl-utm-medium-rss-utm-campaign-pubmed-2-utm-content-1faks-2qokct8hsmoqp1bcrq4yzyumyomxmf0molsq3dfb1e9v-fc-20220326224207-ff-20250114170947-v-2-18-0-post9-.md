description: Sleepiness-related errors are a leading cause of driving accidents, requiring
  drivers to effectively monitor sleepiness levels. However, there are inter-individual
  differences in driving performance after sleep loss, with some showing poor driving
  performance while others show minimal impairment. This research explored if there
  are differences in self-reported sleepiness and driving performance in healthy drivers
  who exhibited vulnerability or resistance to objective driving impairment ...
