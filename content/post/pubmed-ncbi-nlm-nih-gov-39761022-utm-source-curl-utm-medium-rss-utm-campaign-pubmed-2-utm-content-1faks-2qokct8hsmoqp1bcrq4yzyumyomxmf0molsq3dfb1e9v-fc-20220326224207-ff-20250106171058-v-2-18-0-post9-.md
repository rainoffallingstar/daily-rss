description: Soft robotics is gaining interest in rehabilitation applications, bringing
  new opportunities to offset the loss of upper limb motor function following neurological,
  neuromuscular, or traumatic injuries. Unlike conventional rigid robotics, the added
  softness in linkages or joints promises to make rehabilitation robots compliant,
  which translates into higher levels of safety, comfort, usability, and portability,
  opening the door for these rehabilitation technologies to be used in daily life.
