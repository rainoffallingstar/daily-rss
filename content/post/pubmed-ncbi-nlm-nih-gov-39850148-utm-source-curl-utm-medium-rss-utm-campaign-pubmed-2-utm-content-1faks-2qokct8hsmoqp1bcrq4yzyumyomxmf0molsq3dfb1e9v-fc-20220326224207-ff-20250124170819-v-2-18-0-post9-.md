description: Predicting reaction barriers for arbitrary configurations based on only
  a limited set of density functional theory (DFT) calculations would render the design
  of catalysts or the simulation of reactions within complex materials highly efficient.
  We here propose Gaussian process regression (GPR) as a method of choice if DFT calculations
  are limited to hundreds or thousands of barrier calculations. For the case of hydrogen
  atom transfer in proteins, an important reaction in chemistry and ...
