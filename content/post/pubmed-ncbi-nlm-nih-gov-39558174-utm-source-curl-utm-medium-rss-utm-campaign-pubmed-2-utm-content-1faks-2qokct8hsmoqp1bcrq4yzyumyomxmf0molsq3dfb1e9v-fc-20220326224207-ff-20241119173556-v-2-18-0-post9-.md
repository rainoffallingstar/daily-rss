description: Deep mutational scanning is a powerful method for exploring the mutational
  fitness landscape of proteins. Its adaptation to anti-CRISPR proteins, which are
  natural CRISPR-Cas inhibitors and key players in the co-evolution of microbes and
  phages, facilitates their characterization and optimization. Here, we developed
  a robust anti-CRISPR deep mutational scanning pipeline in Escherichia coli that
  combines synthetic gene circuits based on CRISPR interference with flow cytometry
