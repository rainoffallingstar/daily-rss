description: Plant development relies on the precise coordination of cell growth,
  which is influenced by the mechanical constraints imposed by rigid cell walls. The
  hormone auxin plays a crucial role in regulating this growth by altering the mechanical
  properties of cell walls. During the post-embryonic formation of lateral roots,
  pericycle cells deep within the main root are triggered by auxin to resume growth
  and divide to form a new root. This growth involves a complex interplay between
