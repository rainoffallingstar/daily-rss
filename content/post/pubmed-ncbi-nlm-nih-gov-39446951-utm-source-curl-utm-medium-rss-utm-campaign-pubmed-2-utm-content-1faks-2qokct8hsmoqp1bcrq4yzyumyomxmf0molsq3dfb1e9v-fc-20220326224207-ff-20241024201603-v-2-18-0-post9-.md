description: Insect biomass is declining globally, likely driven by climate change
  and pesticide use, yet systematic studies on the effects of various chemicals remain
  limited. In this work, we used a chemical library of 1024 molecules-covering insecticides,
  herbicides, fungicides, and plant growth inhibitors-to assess the impact of sublethal
  pesticide doses on insects. In Drosophila melanogaster, 57% of chemicals affected
  larval behavior, and a higher proportion compromised long-term survivability. ...
