description: We show that strong molecular rotation drastically modifies the autodetachment
  of C_{2}^{-} ions in the lowest quartet electronic state a^{4}Σ_{u}^{+}. In the
  strong-rotation regime, levels of this state only decay by a process termed "rotationally
  assisted" autodetachment, whose theoretical description is worked out based on the
  nonlocal resonance model. For autodetachment linked with the exchange of six rotational
  quanta, the results reproduce a prominent, hitherto unexplained ...
