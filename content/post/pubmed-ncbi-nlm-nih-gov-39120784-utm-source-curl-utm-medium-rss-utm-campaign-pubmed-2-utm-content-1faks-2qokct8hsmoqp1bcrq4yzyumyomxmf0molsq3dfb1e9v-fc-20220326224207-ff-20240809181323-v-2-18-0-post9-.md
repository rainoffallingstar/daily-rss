description: The α9α10 nicotinic cholinergic receptor (nAChR) is a ligand-gated pentameric
  cation-permeable ion channel that mediates synaptic transmission between descending
  efferent neurons and mechanosensory inner ear hair cells. When expressed in heterologous
  systems, α9 and α10 subunits can assemble into functional homomeric α9 and heteromeric
  α9α10 receptors. One of the differential properties between these nAChRs is the
  modulation of their ACh-evoked responses by extracellular calcium (Ca^(2+)). ...
