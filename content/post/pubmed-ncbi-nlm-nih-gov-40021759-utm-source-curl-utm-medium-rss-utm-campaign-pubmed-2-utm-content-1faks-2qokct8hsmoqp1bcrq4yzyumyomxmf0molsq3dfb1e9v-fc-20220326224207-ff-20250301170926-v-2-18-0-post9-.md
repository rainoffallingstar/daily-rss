description: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) is a prevalent malignancy,
  with HPV-negative tumors exhibiting aggressive behavior and poor prognosis. Understanding
  the intricate interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME) is crucial for
  improving prognostic models and identifying therapeutic targets. Using BulkSignalR,
  we identified ligand-receptor interactions in HPV-negative TCGA-HNSC cohort (n =
  395). A prognostic model incorporating 14 ligand-receptor pairs was developed using
