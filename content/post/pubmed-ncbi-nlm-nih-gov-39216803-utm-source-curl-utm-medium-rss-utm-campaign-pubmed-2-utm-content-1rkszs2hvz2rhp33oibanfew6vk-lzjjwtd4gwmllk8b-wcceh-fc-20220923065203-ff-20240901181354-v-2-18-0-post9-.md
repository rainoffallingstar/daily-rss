description: Mastocytosis is a clonal myeloid disorder defined by an increase and
  accumulation of mast cells (MC) in one or multiple organ systems. The complex pathology
  of mastocytosis results in variable clinical presentations, courses, and outcomes.
  The World Health Organization (WHO) divides the disease into cutaneous mastocytosis
  (CM), several forms of systemic mastocytosis (SM), and MC sarcoma. In most SM patients,
  a somatic KIT mutation, usually D816V, is identified. Patients diagnosed with CM
