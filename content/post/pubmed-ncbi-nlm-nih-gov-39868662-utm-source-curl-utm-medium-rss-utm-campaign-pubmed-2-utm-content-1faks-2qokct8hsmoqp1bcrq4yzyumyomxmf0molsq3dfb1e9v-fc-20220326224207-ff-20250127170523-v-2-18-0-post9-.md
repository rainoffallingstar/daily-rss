description: Protein interactions play a crucial role in regulating cellular mechanisms,
  highlighting the need for effective methods to control these processes. In this
  regard, chemical inducers of proximity (CIPs) offer a promising approach to precisely
  manipulate protein-protein interactions in live cells and in vivo. In this study,
  we introduce pMandi, a photocaged version of the plant hormone-based CIP mandipropamid
  (Mandi), which allows the use of light as an external trigger to induce protein
