description: Definitions of human pain acknowledge at least two dimensions of pain,
  affective and sensory, described as separable and thus potentially differentially
  modifiable. Using electroencephalography, we investigated perceptual and neural
  changes of emotional pain modulation in healthy individuals. Painful electrical
  stimuli were applied after presentation of priming emotional pictures (negative,
  neutral, positive) and followed by pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings. We
  found that perceptual ...
