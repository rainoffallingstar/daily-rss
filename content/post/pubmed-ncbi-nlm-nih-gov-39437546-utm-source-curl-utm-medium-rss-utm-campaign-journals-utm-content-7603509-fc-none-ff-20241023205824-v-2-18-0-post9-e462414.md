description: Glutamine dependency has been shown to be a metabolic vulnerability in
  acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Prior studies using several in vivo AML models showed
  that depletion of plasma glutamine induced by the long-acting crisantaspase (pegcrisantaspase
  or PegC) was synergistic with the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax (Ven), resulting in
  significantly reduced leukemia burden and enhanced survival. Here, we report a phase
  1 study (NCT04666649) of Ven and PegC combination (VenPegC) for treating ...
