description: Epilepsy has a peak incidence during the neonatal to early childhood
  period. These early onset epilepsies may be severe conditions frequently associated
  with comorbidities such as developmental deficits and intellectual disability and,
  in a significant percentage of patients, may be medication-resistant. The use of
  adult rodent models in the exploration of mechanisms and treatments for early life
  epilepsies is challenging, as it ignores significant age-specific developmental
  differences. ...
