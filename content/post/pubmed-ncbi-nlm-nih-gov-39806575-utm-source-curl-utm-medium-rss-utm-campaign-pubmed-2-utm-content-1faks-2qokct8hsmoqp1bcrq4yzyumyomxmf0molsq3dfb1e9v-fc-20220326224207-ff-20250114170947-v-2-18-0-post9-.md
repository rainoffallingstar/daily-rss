description: Protein-activated kinases mediate spine morphogenesis and synaptic plasticity.
  PAK3 is part of the p21-activated kinases (PAKs) family of Ras-signaling serine/threonine
  kinases. Pathogenic variants in the X-linked gene PAK3 have been described in patients
  with neurodevelopmental syndromes. We analyzed an Italian family with sleep-related
  hypermotor epilepsy, intellectual disability, psychiatric and behavioral problems,
  and dysmorphic facial features. A novel PAK3 c.342_344del ...
