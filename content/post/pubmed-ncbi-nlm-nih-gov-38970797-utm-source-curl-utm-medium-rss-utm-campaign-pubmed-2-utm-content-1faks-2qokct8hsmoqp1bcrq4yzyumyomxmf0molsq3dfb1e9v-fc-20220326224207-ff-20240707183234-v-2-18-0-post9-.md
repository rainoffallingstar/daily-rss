description: Mesonephric-type (or -like) adenocarcinomas (MAs) of the ovary are an
  uncommon and aggressive histotype. They appear to arise through transdifferentiation
  from Müllerian lesions creating diagnostic challenges. Thus, we aimed to develop
  a histologic and immunohistochemical (IHC) approach to optimize the identification
  of MA over its histologic mimics, such as ovarian endometrioid carcinoma (EC). First,
  we screened 1,537 ovarian epithelial neoplasms with a four-marker IHC panel of GATA3,
  TTF1, ...
