description: Cytokinins (CKs) are phytohormones structurally similar to purines that
  play important roles in various aspects of plant physiology and development. The
  local and long-distance distribution of CKs is very important to control their action
  throughout the plant body. Over the past decade, several novel CK transporters have
  been described, many of which have been linked to a physiological function rather
  than simply their ability to transport the hormone in vitro. Purine permeases, ...
