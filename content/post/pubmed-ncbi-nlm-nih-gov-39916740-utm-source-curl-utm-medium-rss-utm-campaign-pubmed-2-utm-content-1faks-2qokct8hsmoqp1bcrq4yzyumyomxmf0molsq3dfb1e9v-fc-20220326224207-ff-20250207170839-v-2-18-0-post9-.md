description: Chondritic meteorites (chondrites) contain evidence for the interaction
  of liquid water with the interiors of small bodies early in Solar System history.
  Here we review the processes, products and timings of the low-temperature aqueous
  alteration reactions in CR, CM, CI and ungrouped carbonaceous chondrites, the asteroids
  Ryugu and Bennu, and hydrated dark clasts in different types of meteorites. We first
  consider the nature of chondritic lithologies and the insights that they provide
