description: Integrity of epithelial and endothelial cell barriers is of critical
  importance for health, barrier disruption is a hallmark of numerous diseases, of
  which many are driven by carbonyl stressors such as methylglyoxal (MG). Carnosine
  and anserine exert some MG-quenching activity, but the impact of these and of other
  histidine containing dipeptides on cell barrier integrity has not been explored
  in detail. In human proximal tubular (HK-2) and umbilical vein endothelial (HUVEC)
  cells, exposure ...
