description: Photoacoustic imaging is an emerging modality with significant promise
  for biomedical applications such as neuroimaging, owing to its capability to capture
  large fields of view deep inside complex scattering tissue. However, widespread
  adoption of this technique has been hindered by a lack of suitable molecular reporters
  for this modality. In this work, we introduce chemigenetic labels and calcium sensors
  specifically tailored for photoacoustic imaging, using a combination of synthetic
