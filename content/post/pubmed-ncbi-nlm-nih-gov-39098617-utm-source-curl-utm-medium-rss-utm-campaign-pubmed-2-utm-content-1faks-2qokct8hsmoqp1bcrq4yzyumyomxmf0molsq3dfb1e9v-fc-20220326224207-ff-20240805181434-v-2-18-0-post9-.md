description: Synthetic single-chain bolalipids (SSCBs) are novel excipients in drug
  delivery, with potential as stabilizers or solubilizers. However, their impact on
  skin barrier function has not been comprehensively studied. Therefore, two SSCBs
  (PC-C24-PC and PC-C32-PC) were studied in aqueous systems for their impact on penetration
  of a model permeant into porcine skin. Concentrations of 0.05 - 5 % w/w were tested;
  PC-C24-PC formulations were low-viscosity liquids while PC-C32-PC formed ...
