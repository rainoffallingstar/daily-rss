description: Uterine mesenchymal tumours harboring KAT6B/A::KANSL1 gene fusions typically
  exhibit histological and immunophenotypic overlap with endometrial stromal and smooth
  muscle tumours. To date it remains uncertain whether such neoplasms should be regarded
  as variants of smooth muscle or endometrial stromal neoplasm, or if they constitute
  a distinct tumour type. In this study we investigated DNA methylation patterns and
  copy number variations (CNVs) in a series of uterine tumours ...
