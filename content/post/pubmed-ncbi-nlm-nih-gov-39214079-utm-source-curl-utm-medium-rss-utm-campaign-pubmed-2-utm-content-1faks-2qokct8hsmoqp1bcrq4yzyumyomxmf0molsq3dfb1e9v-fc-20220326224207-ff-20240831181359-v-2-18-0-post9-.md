description: 5-Methylcytosine (5mC) is an established epigenetic mark in vertebrate
  genomic DNA, but whether its oxidation intermediates formed during TET-mediated
  DNA demethylation possess an instructive role of their own that is also physiologically
  relevant remains unresolved. Here, we reveal a 5-formylcytosine (5fC) nuclear chromocenter,
  which transiently forms during zygotic genome activation (ZGA) in Xenopus and mouse
  embryos. We identify this chromocenter as the perinucleolar compartment, a ...
