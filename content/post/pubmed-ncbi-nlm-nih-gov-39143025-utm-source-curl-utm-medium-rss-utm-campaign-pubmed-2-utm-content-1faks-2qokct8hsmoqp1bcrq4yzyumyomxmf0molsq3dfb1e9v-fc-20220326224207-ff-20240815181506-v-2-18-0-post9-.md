description: Diaryl-substituted vinyl boronates as potent building modules are challenging
  to synthesize. Herein, we present a convenient strategy based on a gold-catalyzed
  Hiyama arylation of (Z)-β-(borylvinyl)silanes which are easily accessible by hydroboration
  of silylalkynes. By exploiting the highly electronegative nature of the Au(III)
  intermediate (which is accessed by the light-assisted oxidation with aryl diazonium
  salts), a selective activation of the silyl group in the presence of the boron ...
