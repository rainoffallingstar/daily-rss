description: 'CONCLUSION: SSTR-RADS 1.0 represents a highly reproducible and consistent
  framework system for stratifying SSTR-targeted PET/CT scans, even using the novel
  SSTR-ligand [^(18)F]SiTATE. Some inter-reader variability was observed regarding
  the evaluation of uptake intensity prior to PRRT as well as compartment scoring
  of lymph nodes, indicating that those categories require special attention during
  further clinical validation and might be refined in a future SSTR-RADS version ...'
