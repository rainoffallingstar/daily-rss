description: Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CD19-CAR) represent an effective
  treatment for relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies but incomplete responses often
  result in early disease progression. We here assessed potential benefits of co-administering
  CD20-targeting bispecific antibodies (CD20-BsAb) with CD19-CAR, aiming to enhance
