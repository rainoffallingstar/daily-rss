description: Ferroptosis is a pervasive non-apoptotic form of cell death highly relevant
  in various degenerative diseases and malignancies. The hallmark of ferroptosis is
  uncontrolled and overwhelming peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids contained
  in membrane phospholipids, which eventually leads to rupture of the plasma membrane.
  Ferroptosis is unique in that it is essentially a spontaneous, uncatalyzed chemical
  process based on perturbed iron and redox homeostasis contributing to the cell ...
