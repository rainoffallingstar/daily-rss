description: The idea that disease is caused at the cellular level is so fundamental
  to us that we might forget the critical role microscopy played in generating and
  developing this insight. Visually identifying diseased or infected cells lays the
  foundation for any effort to curb human pathology. Since the discovery of the Plasmodium-infected
  red blood cells, which cause malaria, microscopy has undergone an impressive development
  now literally resolving individual molecules. This review explores ...
