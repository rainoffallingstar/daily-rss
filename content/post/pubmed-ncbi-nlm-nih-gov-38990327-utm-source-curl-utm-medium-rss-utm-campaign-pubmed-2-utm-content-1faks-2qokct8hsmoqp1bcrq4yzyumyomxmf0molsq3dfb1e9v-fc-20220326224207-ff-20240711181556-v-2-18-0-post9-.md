description: Energy-transfer processes can be viewed as being due to the emission
  of a virtual photon. It is demonstrated that the emission of virtual photons and
  thus of energy transfer is stimulated by the sheer presence of photons. We concentrate
  here on interatomic/intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD) where an excited system
  relaxes by transferring its excess energy to a neighbor ionizing it. ICD is inactive
  if this excess energy is insufficiently large. However, in the presence of photons,
