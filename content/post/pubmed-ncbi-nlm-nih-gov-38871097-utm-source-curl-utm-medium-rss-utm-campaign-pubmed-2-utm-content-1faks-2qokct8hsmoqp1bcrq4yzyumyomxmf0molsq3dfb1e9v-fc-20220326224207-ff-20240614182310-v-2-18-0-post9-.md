description: Eukaryotic Initiation Translation Factor 2A (EIF2A) is considered to
  be primarily responsible for the initiation of translation when a cell is subjected
  to stressful conditions. However, information regarding this protein is still incomplete.
  Using a combination of proteomic approaches, we demonstrated that EIF2A is the molecular
  target of the naturally occurring bioactive compound cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) within
  human glioblastoma cells. This finding allowed us to undertake a study aimed ...
