  and effective option for patients with persistent TMC-1 symptoms after failed surgeries.
  It uniquely preserves both thumb mobility and length, unlike alternatives like arthrodesis

  research and long-term studies are necessary to determine the definitive role of
  this approach in complex TMC-1 ...'
