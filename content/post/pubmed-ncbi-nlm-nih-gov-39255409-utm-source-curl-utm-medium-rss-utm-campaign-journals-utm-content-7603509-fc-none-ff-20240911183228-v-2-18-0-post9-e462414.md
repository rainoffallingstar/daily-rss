description: Mutations in calreticulin (mutCALR) are the second most common drivers
  of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and yet, the current therapeutic landscape
  lacks a selective agent for mutCALR-expressing MPNs. Here we show that the monoclonal
  antibody INCA033989 selectively targets mutCALR-positive cells. INCA033989 antagonized
  mutCALR-driven signaling and proliferation in engineered cell lines and primary
  CD34+ cells from patients with MPN. No antibody binding or functional activity was
  observed ...
