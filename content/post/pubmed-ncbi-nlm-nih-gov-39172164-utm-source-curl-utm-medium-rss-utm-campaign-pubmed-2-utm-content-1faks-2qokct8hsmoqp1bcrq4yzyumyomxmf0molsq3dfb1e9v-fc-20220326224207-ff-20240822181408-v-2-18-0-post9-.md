description: A variety of situations can lead to the need for an alternative method
  of intraocular lens (IOL) fixation if implantation in the capsular bag is not possible.
  Depending on the situation, sulcus-fixated IOLs, iris-fixated IOLs (IFIOLs) and
  scleral-fixated IOLs (SFIOLs) are available. With SFIOLs, a distinction is made
  between suture-fixated and sutureless-fixated techniques. This paper summarizes
  the advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches, including the newer
  methods ...
