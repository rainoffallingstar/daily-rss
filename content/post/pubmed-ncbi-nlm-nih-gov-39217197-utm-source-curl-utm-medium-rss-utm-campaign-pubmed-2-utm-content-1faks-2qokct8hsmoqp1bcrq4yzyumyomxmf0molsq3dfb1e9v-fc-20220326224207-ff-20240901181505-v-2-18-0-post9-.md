description: Prostate cancer is characterized by a high degree of intratumoral heterogeneity.
  However, little is known about the spatial distribution of cancer cells with respect
  to specific functional characteristics and the formation of spatial niches. Here,
  we used digital spatial profiling (DSP) to investigate differences in protein expression
  in the tumor center versus the tumor periphery. Thirty-seven regions of interest
  were analyzed for the expression of 47 proteins, which included components of ...
