  <p>Overview<br />
  In many real data applications we are often required to model jointly \(d\geq 3\) continuous random variables, denoted as \(Y_1,\dots,Y_d\) . The multivariate distribution, which allows us to describe the joint behaviour of those variables, can be denoted as \(F(Y_1,\dots,Y_d)=P(Y_1\le ...</p></div>
