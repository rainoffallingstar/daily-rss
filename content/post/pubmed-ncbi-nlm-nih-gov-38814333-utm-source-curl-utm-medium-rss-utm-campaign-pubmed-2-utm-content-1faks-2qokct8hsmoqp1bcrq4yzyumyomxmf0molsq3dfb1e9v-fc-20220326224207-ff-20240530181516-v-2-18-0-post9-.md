description: Tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH) is an organic hydroperoxide widely
  used as a model compound to induce oxidative stress. It leads to a plethora of cellular
  damage, including lipid peroxidation, DNA double-strand breaks (DNA DSBs), and breakdown
  of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). We could show in several cell lines
  that t-BuOOH induces ferroptosis, triggered by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation.
  We have further revealed that not only t-BuOOH-mediated ferroptosis, but also DNA
