description: In mice, variability in adult bone size and density has been observed
  among common inbred strains. Also, in the group of genes regulating circadian rhythmicity
  in mice, so called clock genes, changes in body size and skeletal parameters have
  been noted in knockout mice. Here, we studied the size and density of prominent
  bones of the axial and appendicular skeleton of clock gene Period-1-deficient (Per1^(-/-))
  mice by means of microcomputed tomography. Our data show shorter spinal length,
