description: Pediatric high-grade gliomas are a devastating subset of brain tumors,
  characterized by their aggressive pathophysiology and limited treatment options.
  Among them, H3 K27-altered diffuse midline gliomas (DMG) of the brainstem stand
  out due to their distinct molecular features and dismal prognosis. Recent advances
  in molecular profiling techniques have unveiled the critical role of H3 K27 alterations,
  particularly a lysine-to-methionine mutation on position 27 (K27M) of the histone
  H3 tail, ...
