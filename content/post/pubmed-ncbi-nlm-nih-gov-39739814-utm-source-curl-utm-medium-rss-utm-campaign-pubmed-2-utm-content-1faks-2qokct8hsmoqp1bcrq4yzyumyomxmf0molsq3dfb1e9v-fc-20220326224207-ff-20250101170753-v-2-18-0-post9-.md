description: Ferroptosis, a unique form of iron-dependent cell death triggered by
  lipid peroxidation accumulation, holds great promise for cancer therapy. Despite
  the crucial role of GPX4 in regulating ferroptosis, our understanding of GPX4 protein
  regulation remains limited. Through FACS-based genome-wide CRISPR screening, we
  identified MALT1 as a regulator of GPX4 protein. Inhibition of MALT1 expression
  enhances GPX4 ubiquitination-mediated degradation by up-regulating the E3 ubiquitin
  ligase RC3H1. ...
