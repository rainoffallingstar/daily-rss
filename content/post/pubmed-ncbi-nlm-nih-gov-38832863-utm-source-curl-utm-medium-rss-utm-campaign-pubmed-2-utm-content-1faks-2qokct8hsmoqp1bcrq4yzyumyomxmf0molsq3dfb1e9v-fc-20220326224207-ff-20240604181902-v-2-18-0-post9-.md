description: For many years, non-invasive methods to measure intracranial pressure
  (ICP) have been unsuccessful. However, such methods are crucial for the assessment
  of patients with non-penetrating traumatic brain injuries (TBI) who are unconscious.
  In this study, we explored the use of Transcranial Transmission Ultrasound (TTUS)
  to gather experimental data through brain pulsatility, assessing its effectiveness
  in detecting high ICP using machine learning analysis. We included patients with
  severe TBI ...
