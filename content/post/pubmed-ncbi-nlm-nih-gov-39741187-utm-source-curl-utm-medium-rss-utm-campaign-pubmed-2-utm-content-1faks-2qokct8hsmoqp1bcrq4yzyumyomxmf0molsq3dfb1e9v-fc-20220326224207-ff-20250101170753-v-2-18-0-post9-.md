description: Bladder cancer poses significant clinical challenges due to its high
  metastatic potential and poor prognosis, especially when it progresses to muscle-invasive
  stages. Here, we show that the m⁶A reader YTHDC1 is downregulated in muscle-invasive
  bladder cancer and is negatively correlated with the expression of epithelial‒mesenchymal
  transition genes. The functional inhibition or depletion of YTHDC1 increased the
  migration and invasion of urothelial cells. Integrative analysis of ...
