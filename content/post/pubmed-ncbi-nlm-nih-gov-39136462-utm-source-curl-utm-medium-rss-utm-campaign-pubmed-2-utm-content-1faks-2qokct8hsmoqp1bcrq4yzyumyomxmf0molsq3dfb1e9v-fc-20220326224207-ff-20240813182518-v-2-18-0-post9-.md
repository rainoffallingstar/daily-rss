description: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 assembly is initiated by Gag binding
  to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (PM). Gag targeting is mediated by its
  N-terminally myristoylated matrix (MA) domain and PM phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
  [PI(4,5)P(2)]. Upon Gag assembly, envelope (Env) glycoproteins are recruited to
  assembly sites; this process depends on the MA domain of Gag and the Env cytoplasmic
  tail. To investigate the dynamics of Env recruitment, we applied a chemical ...
