description: This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of eltrombopag plus
  diacerein vs. eltrombopag alone in patients with primary immune thrombocytopenia
  (ITP) who were previously unresponsive to 14 days of eltrombopag treatment at the
  full dose. Recruited patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either eltrombopag
  plus diacerein (n=50) or eltrombopag monotherapy (n=52). Overall response rate,
  defined as a platelet count at or above 30×109/L, at least doubling of the baseline
