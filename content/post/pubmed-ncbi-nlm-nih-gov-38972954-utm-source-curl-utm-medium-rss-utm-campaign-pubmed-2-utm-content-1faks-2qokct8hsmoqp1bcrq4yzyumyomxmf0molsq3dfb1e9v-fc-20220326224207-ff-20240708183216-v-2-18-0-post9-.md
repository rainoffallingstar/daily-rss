description: Leukemias with ambiguous lineage comprise several loosely defined entities,
  often without a clear mechanistic basis. Here, we extensively profile the epigenome
  and transcriptome of a subgroup of such leukemias with CpG Island Methylator Phenotype.
  These leukemias exhibit comparable hybrid myeloid/lymphoid epigenetic landscapes,
  yet heterogeneous genetic alterations, suggesting they are defined by their shared
  epigenetic profile rather than common genetic lesions. Gene expression ...
