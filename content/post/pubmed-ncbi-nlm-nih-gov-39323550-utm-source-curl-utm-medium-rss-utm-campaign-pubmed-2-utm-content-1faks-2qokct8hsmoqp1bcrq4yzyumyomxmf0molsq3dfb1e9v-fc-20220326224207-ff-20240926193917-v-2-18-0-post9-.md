description: The transcriptional machinery is essential for gene expression and regulation;
  dysregulation of transcription can result in a range of pathologies, including neurodegeneration,
  cancer, developmental disorders and cardiovascular disease. A key component of RNA
  polymerase II-mediated transcription is the basal transcription factor IID, which
  is formed of the TATA box-binding protein (TBP) and 14 TBP-associated factors (TAFs),
  the largest of which is the TAF1 protein, encoded on the X ...
