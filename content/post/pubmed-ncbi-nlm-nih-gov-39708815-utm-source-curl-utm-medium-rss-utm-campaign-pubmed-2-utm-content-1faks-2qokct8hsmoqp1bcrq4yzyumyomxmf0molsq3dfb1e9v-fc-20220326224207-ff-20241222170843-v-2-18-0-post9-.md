description: Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) presents antigens
  to T helper cells. The spectrum of presented peptides is regulated by the exchange
  catalyst human leukocyte antigen DM (HLA-DM), which dissociates peptide-MHC-II complexes
  in the endosome. How susceptible a peptide is to HLA-DM is mechanistically not understood.
  Here, we present a data-driven mathematical model for the conformational landscape
  of MHC-II that explains the wide range of measured HLA-DM susceptibilities ...
