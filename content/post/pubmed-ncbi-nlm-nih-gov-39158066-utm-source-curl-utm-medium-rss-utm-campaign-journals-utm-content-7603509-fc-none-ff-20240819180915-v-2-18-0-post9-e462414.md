description: Multiple Myeloma (MM) is an incurable malignancy characterised by altered
  expression of coding and non-coding genes promoting tumour growth and drug resistance.
  Although the crucial role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in MM is clearly established,
  the function of the non-coding RNAome, which might allow the design of novel therapeutics,
  is largely unknown. We performed an unbiased CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screen
  of 671 lncRNAs in MM cells and their Bortezomib (BZB)-resistant ...
