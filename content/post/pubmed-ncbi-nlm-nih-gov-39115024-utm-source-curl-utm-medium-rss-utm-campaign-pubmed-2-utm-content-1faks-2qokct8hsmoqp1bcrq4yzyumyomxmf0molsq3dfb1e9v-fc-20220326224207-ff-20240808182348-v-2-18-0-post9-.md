description: Pea is a grain legume crop with a high potential to accelerate the food
  transition due to its high seed protein content and relatively well-balanced amino
  acid composition. The critical role of external sulfur (S) supply in determining
  seed yield and seed quality in pea makes it essential to understand the impact of
  whole plant S management on the trade-off between these two traits. Here, we investigated
  the physiological relevance of vacuolar sulfate remobilization by targeting PsSULTR4,
