  structural variation (SV) across genomes. However, extensive DNA rearrangements
  arising through a series of mutations, a phenomenon we refer to as serial SV (sSV),
  remain underexplored, posing a challenge for SV discovery. Here, we present NAHRwhals
  ( https://github.com/WHops/NAHRwhals ), a method to infer repeat-mediated series
  of SVs in long-read genomic assemblies. Applying NAHRwhals to haplotype-resolved
