description: White-nose syndrome (WNS), a disease affecting hibernating bats, is caused
  by the fungal pathogen Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd). Since the initial introduction
  of Pd from Eurasia to the United States in 2006, WNS has killed millions of bats
  throughout the temperate parts of North America. There is concern that if Pd is
  accidentally introduced to the Southern Hemisphere, WNS could pose similar threats
  to the bat fauna of the Southern Hemisphere's more temperate regions. Efforts are
