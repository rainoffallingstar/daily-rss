description: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has high metastatic potential and is hard
  to detect early. This study aims to develop a deep learning model for NPC diagnosis
  using optical imagery. From April 2008 to May 2021, we analyzed 12,087 nasopharyngeal
  endoscopic images and 309 videos from 1,108 patients. The pretrained model was fine-tuned
  with stochastic gradient descent on the final layers. Data augmentation was applied
  during training. Videos were converted to images for malignancy ...
