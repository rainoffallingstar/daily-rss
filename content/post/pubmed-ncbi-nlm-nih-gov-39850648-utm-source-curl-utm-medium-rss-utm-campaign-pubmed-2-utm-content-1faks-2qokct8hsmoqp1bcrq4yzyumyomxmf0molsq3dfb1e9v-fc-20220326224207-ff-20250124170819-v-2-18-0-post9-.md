description: Lower risk (LR) myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are heterogeneous hematopoietic
  stem and progenitor disorders caused by the accumulation of somatic mutations in
  various genes including epigenetic regulators that may produce convergent DNA methylation
  patterns driving specific gene expression profiles. The integration of genomic,
  epigenomic, and transcriptomic profiling has the potential to spotlight distinct
  LR-MDS categories on the basis of pathophysiological mechanisms. We performed ...
