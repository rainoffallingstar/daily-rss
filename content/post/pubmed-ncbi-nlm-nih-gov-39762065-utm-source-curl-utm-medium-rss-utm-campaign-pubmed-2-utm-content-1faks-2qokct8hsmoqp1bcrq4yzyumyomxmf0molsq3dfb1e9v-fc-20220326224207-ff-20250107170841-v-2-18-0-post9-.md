description: Adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC) of the breast is a rare histological
  subtype of breast cancer, which usually has a low propensity for metastasis and
  is associated with a good prognosis. AdCC metastasis to the kidney is rare, with
  only 29 cases reported in the literature. We report a case of a woman in her 60s
  with multiple right-sided large cystic-solid renal lesions after a recent diagnosis
  of marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. The patient previously had T1c N0 breast AdCC,
  treated with ...
