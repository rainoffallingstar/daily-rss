description: Balanced rearrangements involving the KMT2A gene (KMT2Ar) are recurrent
  genetic abnormalities in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but there is lack of consensus
  regarding the prognostic impact of different fusion partners. Moreover, prognostic
  implications of gene mutations co-occurring with KMT2Ar are not established. From
  the HARMONY AML database 205 KMT2Ar adult patients were selected, 185 of whom had
  mutational information by a panel-based next-generation sequencing analysis. Overall
