description: MDM2 inhibitors are promising therapeutics for acute myeloid leukemia
  (AML) with wild-type TP53. Through an integrated analysis of functional genomic
  data from primary patient samples, we found that an MDM2 inhibitor idasanutlin,
  like venetoclax, is ineffective against monocytic leukemia (FAB M4/M5). To dissect
  the underlying resistance mechanisms, we explored both intrinsic and extrinsic factors.
  We found that monocytic leukemia cells express elevated levels of CEBPB, which promotes
