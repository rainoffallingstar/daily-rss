description: Lycium barbarum, a member of the Solanaceae family, represents an important
  eudicot lineage with homology of food and medicine. Lycium barbarum pectin polysaccharides
  (LBPPs) are key bioactive ingredients of Lycium barbarum, and are among the few
  polysaccharides with both biocompatibility and biomedical activity. While previous
  studies have primarily focused on the functional properties of LBPPs, the mechanisms
  of biosynthesis and transport by key enzymes remain poorly understood. Here, ...
