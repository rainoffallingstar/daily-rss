description: Increased glycolytic flux is a hallmark of cancer; however, an increasing
  body of evidence indicates that glycolytic ATP production may be dispensable in
  cancer, as metabolic plasticity allows cancer cells to readily adapt to disruption
  of glycolysis by increasing ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation. Using
  functional genomic screening, we show here that liver cancer cells show a unique
  sensitivity toward aldolase A (ALDOA) depletion. Targeting glycolysis by disrupting
