description: In current bioinformatics research, spatial transcriptomics (ST) as a
  rapidly evolving technology is gradually receiving widespread attention from researchers.
  Spatial domains are regions where gene expression and histology are consistent in
  space, and detecting spatial domains can better understand the organization and
  functional distribution of tissues. Spatial domain recognition is a fundamental
  step in the process of ST data interpretation, which is also a major challenge in
