description: 'CONCLUSION: Our study showed that an appropriate size of Zero-profile
  implant system is crucial to achieving favorable clinical and radiological outcomes
  after performing ACDF. Implants with a larger height but not oversize could maintain
  the cervical sagittal balance and FSU height and achieve early bone fusion. Therefore,
  a larger height might be a better choice for achieving a satisfactory long-term
  prognosis if Zero-profile implants of adjacent size both fit the disc space ...'
