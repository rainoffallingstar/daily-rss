description: Vibrio cholerae is a Gram-negative bacterium found in aquatic environments
  and is the aetiological agent of cholera, characterized by acute watery diarrhoea
  and severe dehydration. Cholera presents a significant global health burden of an
  estimated 1.3-5 million annual cases, with the current pandemic caused by a toxigenic
  lineage of the O1 El Tor biotype called seventh pandemic El Tor (7PET) that is still
  ongoing. Whilst it is known that non-7PET lineages can cause sporadic disease, little
