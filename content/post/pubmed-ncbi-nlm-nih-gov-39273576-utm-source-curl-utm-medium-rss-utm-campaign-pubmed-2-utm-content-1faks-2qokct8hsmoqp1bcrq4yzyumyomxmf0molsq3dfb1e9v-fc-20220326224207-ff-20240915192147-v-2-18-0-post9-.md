description: Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors in adults
  and typically have a slow-growing and benign nature. However, there is also a substantial
  subset of meningiomas that shows aggressive clinical behavior and is refractory
  to standard treatment modalities, which are still limited to surgery and/or radiotherapy.
  Despite intensive research, no systemic treatment options are yet available in the
  clinic for these challenging tumors, resulting in poor patient outcome. ...
