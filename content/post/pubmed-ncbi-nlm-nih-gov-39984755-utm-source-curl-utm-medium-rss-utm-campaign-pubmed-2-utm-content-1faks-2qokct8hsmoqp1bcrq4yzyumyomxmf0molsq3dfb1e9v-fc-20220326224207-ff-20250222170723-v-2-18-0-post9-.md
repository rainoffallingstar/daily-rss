description: The cGAS-STING signalling pathway has a central role in the innate immune
  response to extrinsic and intrinsic sources of cytoplasmic dsDNA. At the core of
  this pathway is cGAS-dependent production of the intra- and extra-cellular messenger
  cGAMP, which activates STING and leads to IRF3-dependent expression of cytokines
  and interferons. Despite its relevance to viral and bacterial infections, cell death,
  and genome instability, the lack of specific live-cell reporters has precluded ...
