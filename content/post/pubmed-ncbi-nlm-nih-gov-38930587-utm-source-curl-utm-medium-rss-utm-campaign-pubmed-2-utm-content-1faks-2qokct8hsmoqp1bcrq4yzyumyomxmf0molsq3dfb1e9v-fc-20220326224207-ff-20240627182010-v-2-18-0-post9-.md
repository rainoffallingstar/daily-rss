description: We present the validity of using an ultrasensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent
  assay (ELISA) for quantifying high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 E7 oncoproteins
  in urine specimens as a noninvasive method of analyzing the oncogenic activity of
  HPV. Some reports claim that the oncogenic activity of HPV is a more relevant clinical
  indicator than the presence of HPV DNA for estimating malignant potential. In the
  present study, urine containing HPV16 and related types were selected by ...
