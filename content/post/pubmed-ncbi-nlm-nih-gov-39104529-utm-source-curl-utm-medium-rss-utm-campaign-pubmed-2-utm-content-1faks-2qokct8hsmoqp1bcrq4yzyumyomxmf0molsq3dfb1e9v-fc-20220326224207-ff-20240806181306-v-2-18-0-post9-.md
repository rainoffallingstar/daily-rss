description: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is one of the most devasting diseases
  affecting preterm neonates. However, despite a lot of research, NEC's pathogenesis
  remains unclear. It is known that the pathogenesis is a multifactorial process,
  including (1) a pathological microbiome with abnormal bacterial colonization, (2)
  an immature immune system, (3) enteral feeding, (3) an impairment of microcirculation,
  and (4) possibly ischemia-reperfusion damage to the intestine. Overall, the immaturity
