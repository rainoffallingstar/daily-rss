description: The contribution of deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) to β-Catenin stabilization
  in intestinal stem cells and colorectal cancer (CRC) is poorly understood. Here,
  and by using an unbiassed screen, we discovered that the DUB USP10 stabilizes β-Catenin
  specifically in APC-truncated CRC in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic studies, including
  in vitro binding together with computational modelling, revealed that USP10 binding
  to β-Catenin is mediated via the unstructured N-terminus of USP10 and ...
