description: Teclistamab is a B‑cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-directed bispecific
  antibody approved for the treatment of patients with triple-class exposed relapsed/refractory
  multiple myeloma. In the phase 1/2 MajesTEC-1 study, a cohort of patients who had
  prior BCMA-targeted therapy (antibody-drug conjugate [ADC] or CAR-T cell therapy)
  were enrolled to explore teclistamab in patients previously exposed to anti-BCMA
