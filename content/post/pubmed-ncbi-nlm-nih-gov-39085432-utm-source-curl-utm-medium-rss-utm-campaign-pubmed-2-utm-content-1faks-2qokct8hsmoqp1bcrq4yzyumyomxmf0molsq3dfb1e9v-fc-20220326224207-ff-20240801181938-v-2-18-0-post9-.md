description: Single-cell bisulfite sequencing (scBS) is a technique that enables the
  assessment of DNA methylation at single-base pair and single-cell resolution. The
  analysis of large datasets obtained from scBS requires preprocessing to reduce the
  data size, improve the signal-to-noise ratio and provide interpretability. Typically,
  this is achieved by dividing the genome into large tiles and averaging the methylation
  signals within each tile. Here we demonstrate that this coarse-graining approach
  can ...
