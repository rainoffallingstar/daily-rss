description: Circulating amyloid-beta 1-40 (Αb40) has pro-atherogenic properties and
  could serve as a biomarker in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). However,
  the association of Ab40 levels with morphological characteristics reflecting atherosclerotic
  plaque echolucency and composition is not available. Carotid atherosclerosis was
  assessed in consecutively recruited individuals without ASCVD (n = 342) by ultrasonography.
  The primary endpoint was grey scale median (GSM) of intima-media ...
