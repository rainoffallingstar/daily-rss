description: Recent epidemiological studies have suggested a positive association
  between ultra-processed food consumption and breast cancer risk, although some studies
  also reported no association. Furthermore, the evidence regarding the associations
  between intake of food with lower degrees of processing and breast cancer risk is
  limited. Thus, we investigated the associations between dietary intake by degree
