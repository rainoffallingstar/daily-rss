description: Diplomonads are anaerobic, flagellated protists, being part of the Metamonada
  group of Eukaryotes. Diplomonads either live as endobionts (parasites and commensals)
  of animals or free-living in low-oxygen environments. Genomic information is available
  for parasitic diplomonads like Giardia intestinalis and Spironucleus salmonicida,
  while little is known about the genomic arrangements of free-living diplomonads.
  We have generated the first reference genome of a free-living diplomonad, ...
