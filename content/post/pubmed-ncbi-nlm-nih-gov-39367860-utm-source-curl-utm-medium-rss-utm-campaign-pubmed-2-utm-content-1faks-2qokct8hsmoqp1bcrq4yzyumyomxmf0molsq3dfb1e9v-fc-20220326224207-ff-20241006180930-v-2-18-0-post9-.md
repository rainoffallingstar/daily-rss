description: The synaptic vesicle cluster (SVC) is an essential component of chemical
  synapses, which provides neurotransmitter-loaded vesicles during synaptic activity,
  at the same time as also controlling the local concentrations of numerous exo- and
  endocytosis cofactors. In addition, the SVC hosts molecules that participate in
  other aspects of synaptic function, from cytoskeletal components to adhesion proteins,
  and affects the location and function of organelles such as mitochondria and the
