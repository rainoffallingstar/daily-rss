description: Recombinase-activating gene (RAG)-deficient SCID patients lack B and
  T lymphocytes due to the inability to rearrange immunoglobulin and T cell receptor
  genes. The two RAG genes act as a required dimer to initiate gene recombination.
  Gene therapy is a valid treatment alternative for RAG-SCID patients who lack a suitable
  bone marrow donor, but developing such therapy for RAG1/2 has proven challenging.
  Using a clinically approved lentiviral vector with a codon-optimized RAG1 gene,
  we report ...
