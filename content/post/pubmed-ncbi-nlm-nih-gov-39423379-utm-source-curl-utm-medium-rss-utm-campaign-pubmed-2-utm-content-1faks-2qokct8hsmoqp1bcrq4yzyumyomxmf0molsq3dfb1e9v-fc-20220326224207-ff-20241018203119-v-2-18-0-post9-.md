description: The associated production of Higgs and W bosons via vector-boson fusion
  is highly sensitive to the relative sign of the Higgs boson couplings to W and Z
  bosons. In this Letter, two searches for this process are presented, using 140 fb^{-1}
  of proton-proton collision data at sqrt[s]=13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector
  at the LHC. The first search targets scenarios with opposite-sign couplings of the
  W and Z bosons to the Higgs boson, while the second targets standard model-like
  scenarios ...
