description: 'CONCLUSION: We have shown that the use of the automated MEANS algorithm
  may lead to an overestimation of HRV due to the misclassification of non-sinus beats,
  especially in frequency domain parameters. However, in population-based studies,
  this has no effect on the observed associations of HRV with risk factors, and therefore
  an automated ECG analyzing algorithm as MEANS can be recommended here for the determination
  of HRV ...'
