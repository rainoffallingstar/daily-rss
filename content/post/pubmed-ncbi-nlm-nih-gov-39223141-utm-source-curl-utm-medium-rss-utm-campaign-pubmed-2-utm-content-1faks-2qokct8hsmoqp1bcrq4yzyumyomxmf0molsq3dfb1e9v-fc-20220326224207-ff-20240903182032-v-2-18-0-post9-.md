description: The dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycosyltransferase non-catalytic
  subunit (DDOST) is a key component of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex catalyzing
  N-linked glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. DDOST is associated with
  several cancers and congenital disorders of glycosylation. However, its role in
  pancreatic cancer remains elusive, despite its enriched pancreatic expression. Using
  quantitative mass spectrometry, we identify 30 differentially expressed proteins
