  Blautia obeum A2-162 which has antimicrobial activity against clinically relevant
  organisms. The nisin O biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) varies from other nisin BGCs
  as it lacks a leader-peptide cleaving protease and contains two bacterial two-component
  response regulator-histidine kinase (RK) systems. The dissemination of the nisin
  O cluster, the final proteolytic biosynthesis step and the regulation of nisin O
