description: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer and the
  third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, with no precise method for
  early detection. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) expressing the dynamic polarity
  of the cytoskeletal membrane protein, ezrin, have been proposed to play a crucial
  role in tumor progression and metastasis. This study investigated the diagnostic
  and prognostic potential of polarized circulating tumor cells (p-CTCs) in HCC patients.
