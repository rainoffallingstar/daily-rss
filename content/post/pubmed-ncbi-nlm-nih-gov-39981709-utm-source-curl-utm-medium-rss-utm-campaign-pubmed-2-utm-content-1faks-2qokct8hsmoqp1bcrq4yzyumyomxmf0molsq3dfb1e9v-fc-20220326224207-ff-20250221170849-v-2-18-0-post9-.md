description: Early delayed gastric conduit emptying (DGCE) is a frequent complication
  after Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy (ILE). Despite its relevance, few studies are published
  using the international consensus criteria. Therefore, we aimed to assess predictors
  and clinical consequences of DGCE in patients after ILE. This analysis represents
  a retrospective, single-center cohort study of patients who underwent ILE (2016-2021).
  DGCE was assessed by the international consensus criteria. Univariable and ...
