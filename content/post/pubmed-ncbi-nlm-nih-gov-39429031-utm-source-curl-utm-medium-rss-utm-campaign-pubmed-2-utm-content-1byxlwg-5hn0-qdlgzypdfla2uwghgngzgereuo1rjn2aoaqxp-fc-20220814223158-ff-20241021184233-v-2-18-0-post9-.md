description: Leukemia is a hematological malignancy that significantly impacts the
  human immune system. Early detection helps to effectively manage and treat cancer.
  Although deep learning techniques hold promise for early detection of blood disorders,
  their effectiveness is often limited by the physical constraints of available datasets
  and deployed devices. For this investigation, we collect an excellent-quality dataset
  of 17,826 morphological bone marrow cell images from 85 patients ...
