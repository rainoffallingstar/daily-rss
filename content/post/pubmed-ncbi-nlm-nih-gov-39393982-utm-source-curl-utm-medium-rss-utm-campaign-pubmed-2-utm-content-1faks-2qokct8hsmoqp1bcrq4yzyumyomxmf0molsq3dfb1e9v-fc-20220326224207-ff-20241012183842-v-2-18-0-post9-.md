description: Previous studies indicate that transcranial direct current stimulation
  (tDCS) is a promising emerging treatment option for autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
  and its efficacy could be augmented using concurrent training. However, no intrastimulation
  social cognition training for ASD has been developed so far. The objective of this
  two-armed, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial is to investigate
