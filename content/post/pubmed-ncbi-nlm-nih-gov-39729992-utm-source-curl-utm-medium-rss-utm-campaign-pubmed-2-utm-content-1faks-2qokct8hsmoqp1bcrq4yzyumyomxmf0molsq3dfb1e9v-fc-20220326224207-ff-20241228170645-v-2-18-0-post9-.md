description: B cell immunity carries the inherent risk of deviating into autoimmunity
  and malignancy, which are both strongly associated with genetic variants or alterations
  that increase immune signaling. Here, we investigated the interplay of autoimmunity
  and lymphoma risk factors centered around the archetypal negative immune regulator
  TNFAIP3/A20 in mice. Counterintuitively, B cells with moderately elevated sensitivity
  to stimulation caused fatal autoimmune pathology, while those with high ...
