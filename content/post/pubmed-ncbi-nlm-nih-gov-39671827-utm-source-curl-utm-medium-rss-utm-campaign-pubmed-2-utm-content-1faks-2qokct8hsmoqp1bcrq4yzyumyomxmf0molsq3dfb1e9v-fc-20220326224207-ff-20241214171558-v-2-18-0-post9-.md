description: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), including the Group 1 human
  carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), are produced by the incomplete combustion of organic
  matter and thus are present in tobacco smoke, charbroiled food and diesel exhaust.
  The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an established model organism, however it
  lacks the genetic components of the classical mammalian cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated
  BaP-diol-epoxide metabolism pathway. We therefore introduced human CYP1A1 or CYP1A2
