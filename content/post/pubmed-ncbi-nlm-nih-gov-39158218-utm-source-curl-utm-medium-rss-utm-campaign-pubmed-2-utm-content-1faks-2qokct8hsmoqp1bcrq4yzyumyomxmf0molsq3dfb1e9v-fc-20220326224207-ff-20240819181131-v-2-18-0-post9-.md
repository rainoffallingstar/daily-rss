description: Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) is a commonly used
  treatment in multiple myeloma (MM). However, real-world global demographic and outcome
  data are scarce. We collected data on baseline characteristics and outcomes from
  61 725 patients with newly diagnosed MM who underwent upfront AHCT between 2013
  and 2017 from nine national/international registries. The primary endpoint was overall
  survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS),
