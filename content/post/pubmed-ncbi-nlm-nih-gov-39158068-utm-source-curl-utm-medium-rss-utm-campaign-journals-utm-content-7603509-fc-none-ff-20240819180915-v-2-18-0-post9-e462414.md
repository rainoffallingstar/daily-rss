description: The genetic background of the high prevalence red blood cell antigen
  AnWj has remained unresolved since its identification in 1972, despite reported
  associations with both CD44 and Smyd1 histone methyltransferase. Development of
  anti-AnWj, which may be clinically significant, is usually due to transient suppression
  of antigen expression, but a small number of individuals with persistent, autosomally-recessive
  inherited AnWj-negative phenotype have been reported. Whole exome sequencing ...
