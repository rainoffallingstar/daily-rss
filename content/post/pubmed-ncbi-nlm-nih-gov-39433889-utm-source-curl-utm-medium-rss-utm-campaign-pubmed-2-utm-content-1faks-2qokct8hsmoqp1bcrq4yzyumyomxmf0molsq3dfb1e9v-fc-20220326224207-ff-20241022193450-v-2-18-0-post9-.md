description: Subcortical brain structures are involved in developmental, psychiatric
  and neurological disorders. Here we performed genome-wide association studies meta-analyses
  of intracranial and nine subcortical brain volumes (brainstem, caudate nucleus,
  putamen, hippocampus, globus pallidus, thalamus, nucleus accumbens, amygdala and
  the ventral diencephalon) in 74,898 participants of European ancestry. We identified
  254 independent loci associated with these brain volumes, explaining up to 35% ...
