description: 'CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of the pons-to-superior vermis area ratio can
  discriminate ARSACS from other SPAX patients, as exemplified here by SPG7. Hence,
  we hereby propose this ratio as the Magnetic Resonance Index for the Assessment
  and Recognition of patients harboring SACS mutations (MRI-ARSACS), a novel diagnostic
  tool able to identify ARSACS patients and useful for discriminating ARSACS from
  other SPAX patients undergoing MRI. © 2024 International Parkinson and Movement
