description: Large-scale and continuous conformational changes in the RNA self-folding
  process present significant challenges for structural studies, often requiring trade-offs
  between resolution and observational scope. Here, we utilize individual-particle
  cryo-electron tomography (IPET) to examine the post-transcriptional self-folding
  process of designed RNA origami 6-helix bundle with a clasp helix (6HBC). By avoiding
  selection, classification, averaging, or chemical fixation and optimizing cryo-ET
