  of spiral galaxies and elliptical galaxies^(1,2). Their formation is still an unsolved
  problem^(3-5). Infrared/submillimetre-bright galaxies at high redshifts⁶ have long
  been suspected to be related to spheroid formation^(7-12). Proving this connection

  emission^(13-15) or by methodologies and limited signal-to-noise ratios when looking
