description: Melanoma is an aggressive cancer that has attracted attention in recent
  years due to its high mortality rate of 80%. Damage caused by oxidative stress generated
  by radical (type I reaction) and singlet oxygen, ¹O(2) (type II reaction) oxidative
  reactions may induce cancer. Thus, studies that aim to unveil the mechanism that
  drives these oxidative damage processes become relevant. Ergosterol, an analogue
