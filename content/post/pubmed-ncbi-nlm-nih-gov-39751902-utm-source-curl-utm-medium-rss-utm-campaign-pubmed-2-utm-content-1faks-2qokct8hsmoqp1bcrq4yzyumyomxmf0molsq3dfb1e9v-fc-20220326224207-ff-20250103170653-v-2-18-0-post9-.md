description: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection or reactivation in immune-compromised
  individuals can lead to a wide range of severe complications including hepatitis.
  However, its relation with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) induced hepatitis
  (ICI-hepatitis) and tumor responses in advanced melanoma patients remains unclear.
  Hundred and ninety metastatic cutaneous melanoma patients (mCM) who received ICI
  treatment, with CMV IgG or IgM information available at baseline, were included
