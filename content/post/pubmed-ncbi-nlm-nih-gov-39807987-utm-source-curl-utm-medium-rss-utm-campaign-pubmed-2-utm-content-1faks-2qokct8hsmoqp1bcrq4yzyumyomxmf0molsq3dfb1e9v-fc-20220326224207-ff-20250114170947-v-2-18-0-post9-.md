description: Co-pyrolysis reactions of B(2)Br(4) with S(2)Br(2) at 350 °C in vacuo
  yielded the brominated thiaboranes closo-SB(5)Br(5) (1), closo-1-SB(9)Br(9) (2)
  and closo-SB(11)Br(11) (3), confirmed by high-resolution mass spectrometry, experimental
  and computational ^(11)B NMR spectroscopy. The strong Br^(δ+)(σ-hole)⋯Br^(δ-)(ring)
  attraction has been the decisive energy contribution in the crystal of ...
