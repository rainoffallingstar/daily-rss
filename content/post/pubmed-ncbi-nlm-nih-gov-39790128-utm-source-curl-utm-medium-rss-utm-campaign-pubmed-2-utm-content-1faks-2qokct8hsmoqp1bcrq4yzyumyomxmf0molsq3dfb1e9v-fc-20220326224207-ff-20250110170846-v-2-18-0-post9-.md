CONCLUSIONS: Both intrafractional breathing motion and interfractional translations may impact doses to the PBT during SBRT of ULT. SMART protects the PBT from overdoses while maintaining high PTV coverage. Non-adaptive SBRT appears safe with advanced breathing motion management and PRV, but yields inferior PTV ...
