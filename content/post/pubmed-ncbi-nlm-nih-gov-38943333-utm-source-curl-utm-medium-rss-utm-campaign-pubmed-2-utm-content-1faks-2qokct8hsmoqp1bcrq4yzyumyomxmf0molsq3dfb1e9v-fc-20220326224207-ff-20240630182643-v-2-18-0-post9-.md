description: Transcriptomics is widely used to assess the state of biological systems.
  There are many tools for the different steps, such as normalization, differential
  expression, and enrichment. While numerous studies have examined the impact of method
  choices on differential expression results, little attention has been paid to their
  effects on further downstream functional analysis, which typically provides the
  basis for interpretation and follow-up experiments. To address this, we introduce
