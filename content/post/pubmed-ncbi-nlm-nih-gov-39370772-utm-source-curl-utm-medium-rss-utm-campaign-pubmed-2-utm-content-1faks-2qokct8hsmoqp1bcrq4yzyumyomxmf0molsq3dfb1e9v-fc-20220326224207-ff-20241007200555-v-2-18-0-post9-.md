description: Dehydrogenative coupling (DC) reactions are of importance for the construction
  of new carbon-element bonds in synthetic organic chemistry. In this work, we report
  on the synthesis and characterization of several redox-active guanidino-functionalized
  aromatic molecules (GFAs) for use in DC (C-C and C-O) reactions. In a systematic
  approach, we first characterize the new DC reagents in all relevant redox and protonation
  states, and compare their performance in competitive test ...
