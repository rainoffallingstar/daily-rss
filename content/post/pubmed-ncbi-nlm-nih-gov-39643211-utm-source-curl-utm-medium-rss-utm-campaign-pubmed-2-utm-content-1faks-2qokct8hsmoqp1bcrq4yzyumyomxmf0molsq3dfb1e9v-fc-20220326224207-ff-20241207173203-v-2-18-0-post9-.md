description: The field of aging and longevity research is overwhelmed by vast amounts
  of data, calling for the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), including Large Language
  Models (LLMs), for the evaluation of geroprotective interventions. Such evaluations
  should be correct, useful, comprehensive, explainable, and they should consider
  causality, interdisciplinarity, adherence to standards, longitudinal data and known
  aging biology. In particular, comprehensive analyses should go beyond comparing
  data ...
