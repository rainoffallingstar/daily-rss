description: Differentiation of antigen-activated B cells into pro-proliferative germinal
  center (GC) B cells depends on the activity of the transcription factors MYC and
  BCL6, and the epigenetic writers DOT1L and EZH2. GCB-like Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphomas
  (GCB-DLBCLs) arise from GCB cells and closely resemble their cell of origin. Given
  the dependency of GCB cells on DOT1L and EZH2, we investigated the role of these
  epigenetic regulators in GCB-DLBCLs and observed that GCB-DLBCLs synergistically
