description: Among skin epithelial tumors, recurrent mutations in the APC/CTNNB1 genes
  resulting in activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway have been reported predominantly
  in neoplasms with matrical differentiation. In the present study, we describe the
  morphologic, immunohistochemical, and genetic features of 16 primary cutaneous carcinomas
  harboring mutations activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway without evidence of matrical
  differentiation, as well as four combined tumors in which a similar ...
