description: In order to improve the understanding foot function in the presence of
  planovalgus foot deformity, functional joint center determination is applied to
  the ankle and midfoot for application in 3D-gait analysis. Gait data of 36 patients
  with planovalgus (PV) foot deformity as well as of 33 typically developing (TD)
  subjects were collected using foot markers according to the Heidelberg Foot Measurement
  method. During single-limb stance subjects performed a circular movement of the
