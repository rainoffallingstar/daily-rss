description: Clustering can identify the natural structure that is inherent to measured
  data. For single-cell omics, clustering finds cells with similar molecular phenotype
  after which cell types are annotated. Leiden clustering is one of the algorithms
  of choice in the single-cell community. In the field of spatial omics, Leiden is
  often categorized as a "non-spatial" clustering method. However, we show that by
  integrating spatial information at various steps Leiden clustering is rendered into
