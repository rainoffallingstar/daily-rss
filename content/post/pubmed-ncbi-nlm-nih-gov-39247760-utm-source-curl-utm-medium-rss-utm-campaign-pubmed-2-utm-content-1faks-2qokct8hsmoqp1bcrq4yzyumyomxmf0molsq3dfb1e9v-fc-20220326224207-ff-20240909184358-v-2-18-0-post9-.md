description: The Usutu Virus (USUV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus originated in Africa.
  The virus circulates in Germany since 2010. It is primarily transmitted and maintained
  in the natural cycle by Culex mosquitoes and primarily affects birds, particularly
  Eurasian blackbird (Turdus merula), leading to significant mortality. Several studies
  have reported a high co-infection rate of European birds with both USUV and haemosporidians.
