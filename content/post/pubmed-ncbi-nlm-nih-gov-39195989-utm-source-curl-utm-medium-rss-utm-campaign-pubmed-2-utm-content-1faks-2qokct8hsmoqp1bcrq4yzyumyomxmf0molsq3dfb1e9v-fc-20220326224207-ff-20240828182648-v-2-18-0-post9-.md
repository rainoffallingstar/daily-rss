description: Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is a leading cause of heart failure,
  but knowledge of the full repertoire of cardiac cells and their gene expression
  profiles in the human hypertrophic heart is missing. Here, by using large-scale
  single-nucleus transcriptomics, we present the transcriptional response of human
  cardiomyocytes to pressure overload caused by aortic valve stenosis and describe
  major alterations in cardiac cellular crosstalk. Hypertrophied cardiomyocytes had
