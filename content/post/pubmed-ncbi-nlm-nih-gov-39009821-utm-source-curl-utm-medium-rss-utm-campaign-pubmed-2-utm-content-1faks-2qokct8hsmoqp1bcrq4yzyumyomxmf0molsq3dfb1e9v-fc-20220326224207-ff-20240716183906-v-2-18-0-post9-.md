description: A prospective observational study comparing mechanical power density
  (MP normalized to dynamic compliance) with traditional spontaneous breathing indexes
  (e.g., predicted body weight normalized tidal volume [VT/PBW], rapid shallow breathing
  index [RSBI], or the integrative weaning index [IWI]) for predicting prolonged weaning
  failure in 140 tracheotomized patients. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of these
  indexes at the start and end of the weaning procedure using ROC curve ...
