description: Multiple Myeloma is driven by clonal plasma cell (cPC)-intrinsic factors
  and changes in the tumorigenic microenvironment (TME). To investigate if residual
  polyclonal PCs (pPCs) are disrupted, single-cell (sc) RNAseq and sc B-cell receptor
  analysis were applied in a cohort of 46 samples with PC dyscrasias and 21 healthy
  donors (HDs). Out of n=234,789 PCs, 64,432 were genotypically identified as pPCs
  with frequencies decreasing over different disease stages, from 23.66% in monoclonal
  gammopathy ...
