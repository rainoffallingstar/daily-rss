description: In recent years, phylogenetic reconciliation has emerged as a promising
  approach for studying microbial ecology and evolution. The core idea is to model
  how gene trees evolve along a species tree, and to explain differences between them
  via evolutionary events including gene duplications, transfers, and losses. Here,
  we describe how phylogenetic reconciliation provides a natural framework for studying
  genome evolution, and highlight recent applications including ancestral gene content
