description: The flow convergence method includes calculation of the proximal isovelocity
  surface area (PISA) and is widely used to classify mitral regurgitation (MR) with
  echocardiography. It constitutes a primary decision factor for determination of
  treatment and should therefore be a robust quantification method. However, it is
  known for its tendency to underestimate MR and its dependence on user expertise.
  The present work systematically compares different pulsatile flow profiles arising
