description: The early symptoms of hepatocellular carcinoma patients are often subtle
  and easily overlooked. By the time patients exhibit noticeable symptoms, the disease
  has typically progressed to middle or late stages, missing optimal treatment opportunities.
  Therefore, discovering biomarkers is essential for elucidating their functions for
  the early diagnosis and prevention. In practical research, challenges such as high-dimensional
  features, low sample size, and the complexity of gene ...
