description: Chronic stress (CS) is a debilitating condition that negatively affects
  body and brain. In mice, CS effects range from changes in behaviour and brain microstructure
  down to the level of gene expression. These effects are partly mediated by sex and
  sex steroid hormones, which in turn are affected by the palmitoyl acyltransferase
  ZDHHC7. ZDHHC7 might modulate also the response to CS via palmitoylation of sex
  steroid hormone receptors and other proteins critical for neuronal structure ...
