description: Molecular imaging is a growing field, driven by technological advances,
  such as the improvement of PET-CT scanners through the introduction of digital detectors
  and scanners with an extended field of view, resulting in much higher sensitivity
  and a variety of new specific radiopharmaceuticals that allow the visualization
  of specific molecular pathways and even theragnostic approaches. In oncology, the
  development of dedicated tracers is crucial for personalized therapeutic approaches.
