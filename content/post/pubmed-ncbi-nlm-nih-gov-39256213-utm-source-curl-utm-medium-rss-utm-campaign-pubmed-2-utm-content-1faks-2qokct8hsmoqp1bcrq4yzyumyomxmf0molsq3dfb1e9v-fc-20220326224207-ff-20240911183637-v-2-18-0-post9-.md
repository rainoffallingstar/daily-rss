description: H3 K27M-altered diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are highly malignant tumours
  that arise in the midline structures of the CNS. Most DMGs carry an H3 K27M-mutation
  in one of the genes encoding for histone H3. Recent studies suggested that epigenetic
  subgroups of DMGs can be distinguished based on alterations in the MAPK-signalling
  pathway, tumour localisation, mutant H3-gene, or overall survival (OS). However,
  as these parameters were studied individually, it is unclear how they ...
