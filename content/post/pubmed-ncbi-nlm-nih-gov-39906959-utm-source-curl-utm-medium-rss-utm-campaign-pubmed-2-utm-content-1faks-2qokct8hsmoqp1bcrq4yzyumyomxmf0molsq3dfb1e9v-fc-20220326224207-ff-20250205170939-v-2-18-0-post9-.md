description: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) often arises from preexisting
  cystic lesions such as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) and mucinous
  cystic neoplasms (MCN). This study investigated the molecular heterogeneity and
  mutational landscape of MCN in relation to PDAC, highlighting the significance of
  KRAS mutations in tumor progression. Utilizing targeted next-generation sequencing
