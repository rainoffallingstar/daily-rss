description: We report on the first-in-human clinical trial using chimeric antigen
  receptor (CAR) T-cells targeting CD37, an antigen highly expressed in B- and T-cell
  malignancies (clinicaltrials.gov NCT04136275). Five patients with relapsed or refractory
  CD37+ lymphoid malignancies were enrolled and infused with autologous CAR-37 T-cells.
  CAR-37 T-cells expanded in the peripheral blood of all patients and, at peak, comprised
  >94% of the total lymphocytes in 4/5 patients. Tumor responses were observed in
