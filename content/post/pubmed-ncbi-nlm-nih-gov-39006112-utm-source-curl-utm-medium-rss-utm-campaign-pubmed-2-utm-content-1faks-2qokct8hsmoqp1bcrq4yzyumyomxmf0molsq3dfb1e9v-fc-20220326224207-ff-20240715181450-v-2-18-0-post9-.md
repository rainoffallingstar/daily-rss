description: 'CONCLUSION: ECC was well tolerated, and significant reductions were
  observed in V''O(2), ventilation, and right ventricular load compared with CON,
  even at low intensity levels. This study, conducted on healthy middle-aged participants,
  did not raise concerns that would hinder further investigation of the effects of
  ECC in patients with severely limited cardiopulmonary disease, and it calls for
