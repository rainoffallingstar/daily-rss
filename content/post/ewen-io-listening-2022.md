  <p>Whomst do I think I am with these EOY lists? Anyway here is a collection of
  things I listened to and loved in the big year of 2k22. Have a butchers, there
  might be something in here that you would enjoy playing at unsociable volumes
  whilst driving in your motor, or use to bond with a mate that sincerely
  describes themselves as being &ldquo;into music&rdquo;, or at worst offer a lifeline in a
  pass-the-aux situation where ur other selections are bringing the vibe down.</p>
