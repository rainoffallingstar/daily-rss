description: Chemokines and cytokines represent an emerging field of immunotherapy
  research. They are responsible for the crosstalk and chemoattraction of immune cells
  and tumor cells. For instance, CXCL9/10/11 chemoattract effector CD8^(+) T cells
  to the tumor microenvironment, making an argument for their promising role as biomarkers
  for a favorable outcome. The cytokine Interleukin-15 (IL-15) can promote the chemokine
  expression of CXCR3 ligands but also XCL1, contributing to an important DC-T ...
