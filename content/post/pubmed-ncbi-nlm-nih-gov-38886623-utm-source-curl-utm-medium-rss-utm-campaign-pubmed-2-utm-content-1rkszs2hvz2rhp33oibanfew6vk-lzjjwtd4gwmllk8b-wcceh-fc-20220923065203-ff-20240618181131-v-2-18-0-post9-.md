description: PI3K-δ inhibitors have shown impressive activity in lymphoid malignancies
  but have been hampered by autoimmune and infectious toxicities, leading to market
  withdrawals. We previously demonstrated activity of the PI3K-δγ inhibitor duvelisib
  in T cell lymphomas (TCLs) that was associated with inflammatory adverse events.
  As reported here, we conducted a phase 1b/2a study of duvelisib in combination with
  either romidepsin (n = 66) or bortezomib (n = 32) in patients with relapsed/refractory
