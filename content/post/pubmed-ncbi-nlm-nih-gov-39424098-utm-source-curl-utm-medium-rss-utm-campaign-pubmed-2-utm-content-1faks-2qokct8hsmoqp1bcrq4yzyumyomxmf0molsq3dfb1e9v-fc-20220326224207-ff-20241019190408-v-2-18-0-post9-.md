description: Lipoxygenases catalyze the peroxidation of poly-unsaturated fatty acid
  chains either free or esterified in membrane lipids. Vitis vinifera LoxA is transcriptionally
  induced at ripening onset and localizes at the inner chloroplastic membrane where
  it is responsible for galactolipid regiospecific mono- and di-peroxidation. Here
  we present a kinetic and structural characterization of LoxA. Our X-ray structures
  reveal a constitutive dimer with detergent induced conformational changes ...
