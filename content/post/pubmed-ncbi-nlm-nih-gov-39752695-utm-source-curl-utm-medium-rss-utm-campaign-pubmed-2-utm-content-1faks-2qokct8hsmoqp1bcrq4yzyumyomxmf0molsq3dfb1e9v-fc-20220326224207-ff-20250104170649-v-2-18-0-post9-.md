description: A search for violation of the charge-parity (CP) symmetry in the D^{+}→K^{-}K^{+}π^{+}
  decay is presented, with proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated
  luminosity of 5.4 fb^{-1}, collected at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with the
  LHCb detector. A novel model-independent technique is used to compare the D^{+}
  and D^{-} phase-space distributions, with instrumental asymmetries subtracted using
  the D_{s}^{+}→K^{-}K^{+}π^{+} decay as a control channel. The p value for ...
