description: Thermal proteome profiling (TPP) is a proteome wide technology that enables
  unbiased detection of protein drug interactions as well as changes in post-translational
  state of proteins between different biological conditions. Statistical analysis
  of temperature range TPP (TPP-TR) datasets relies on comparing protein melting curves,
  describing the amount of non-denatured proteins as a function of temperature, between
  different conditions (e.g. presence or absence of a drug). ...
