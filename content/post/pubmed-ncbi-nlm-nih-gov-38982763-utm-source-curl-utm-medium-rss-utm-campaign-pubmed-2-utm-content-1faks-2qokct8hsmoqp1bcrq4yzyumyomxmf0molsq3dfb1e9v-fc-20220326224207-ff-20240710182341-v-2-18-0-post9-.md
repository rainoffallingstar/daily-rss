description: Scattering and localization dynamics of charge carriers in the soft lattice
  of lead-halide perovskites impact polaron formation and recombination, which are
  key mechanisms of material function in optoelectronic devices. In this study, we
  probe the photoinduced lattice and carrier dynamics in perovskite thin films (CsFAPbX(3),
  X = I, Br) using time-resolved infrared spectroscopy. We examine the CN stretching
  mode of formamidinium (FA) cations located within the lead-halide octahedra of ...
