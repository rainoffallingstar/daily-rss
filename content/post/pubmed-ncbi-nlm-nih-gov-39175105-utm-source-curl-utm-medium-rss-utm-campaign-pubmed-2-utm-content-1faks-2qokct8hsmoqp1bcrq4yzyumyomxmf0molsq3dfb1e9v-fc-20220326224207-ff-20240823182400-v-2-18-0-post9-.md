description: Low-dose antiangiogenic therapies have demonstrated the ability to enhance
  normalization of tumor vessels, consequently improving hypoxia levels, drug delivery,
  and promoting anticancer immune responses. Mast cells have been identified as contributors
  to resistance against antiangiogenic therapy and facilitators of abnormal neoangiogenesis.
  In this study, we demonstrate that by simultaneously targeting intratumoral mast
  cells with Imatinib and administering low-dose anti-VEGFR2 ...
