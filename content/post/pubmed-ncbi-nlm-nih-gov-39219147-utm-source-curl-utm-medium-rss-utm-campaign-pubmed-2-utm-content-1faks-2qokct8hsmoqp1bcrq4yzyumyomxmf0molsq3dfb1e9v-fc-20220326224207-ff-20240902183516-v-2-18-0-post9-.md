description: The diagnosis of Sézary syndrome (SS) relies on the identification of
  blood Sézary cells (SC) by different markers via flow cytometry. Treatment of SS
  is challenging since its pathogenesis is characterized by cell death resistance
  rather than hyperproliferation. In this study, we establish an integrated approach
  that considers both the expression of SC markers and sensitivity to cell death both
  spontaneously and upon in vitro treatment. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were
  isolated from 20 ...
