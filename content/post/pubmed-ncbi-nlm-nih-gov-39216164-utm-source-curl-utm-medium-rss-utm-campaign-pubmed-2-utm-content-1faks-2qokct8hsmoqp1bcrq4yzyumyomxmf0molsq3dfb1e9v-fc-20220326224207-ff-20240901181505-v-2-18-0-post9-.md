description: Leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1 (LAIR1) is an inhibitory
  receptor expressed on immune cells. We evaluated LAIR1 in placentas from preeclamptic
  or small for gestational age (SGA) pregnancies, and placental explant model (1 %
  O(2), IL6 and TNFα, or control). LAIR1 mRNA was reduced in placentas from preeclamptic
  (p < 0.0001, n = 78) and SGA (p < 0.0001, n = 32) pregnancies. LAIR1 protein expression
  was reduced in placentas from preeclampsia (p < 0.0001, n = 43) and SGA (p ...
