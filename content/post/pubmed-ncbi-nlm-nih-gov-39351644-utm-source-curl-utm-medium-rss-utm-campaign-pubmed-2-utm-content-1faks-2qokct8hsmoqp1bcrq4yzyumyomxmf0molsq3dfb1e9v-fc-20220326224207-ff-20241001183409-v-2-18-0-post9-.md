description: Rice grains typically contain relatively high levels of toxic arsenic
  (As) but low levels of essential micronutrients. Biofortification of essential micronutrients
  while decreasing As accumulation in rice would benefit human nutrition and health.
  We generated transgenic rice expressing a gain-of-function mutant allele astol1
  driven by the OsGPX1 promoter. astol1 encodes a plastid-localized O-acetylserine
  (thiol) lyase (OAS-TL) with Ser189Asn substitution (OsASTOL1^(S189N)), which ...
