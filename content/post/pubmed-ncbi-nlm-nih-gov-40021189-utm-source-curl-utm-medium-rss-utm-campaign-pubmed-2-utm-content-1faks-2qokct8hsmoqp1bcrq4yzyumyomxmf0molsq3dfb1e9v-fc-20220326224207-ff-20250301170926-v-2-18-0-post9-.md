description: This Letter presents a search for highly ionizing magnetic monopoles
  in 262 μb^{-1} of ultraperipheral Pb+Pb collision data at sqrt[s_{NN}]=5.36 TeV
  collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. A new methodology that exploits the
  properties of clusters of hits reconstructed in the innermost silicon detector layers
  is introduced to study highly ionizing particles in heavy-ion data. No significant
  excess above the background, which is estimated using a data-driven technique, is
  observed. Using ...
