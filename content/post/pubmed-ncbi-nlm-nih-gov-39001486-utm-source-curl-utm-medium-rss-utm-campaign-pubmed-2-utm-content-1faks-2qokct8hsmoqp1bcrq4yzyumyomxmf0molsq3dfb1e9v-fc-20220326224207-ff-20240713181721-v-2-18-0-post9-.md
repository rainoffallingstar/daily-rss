description: Introduction The kinetic of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the early phase
  of therapy with checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) and its prognostic value has already
  been investigated in several tumor entities. In particular, flare dynamics have
  been described as a positive prognostic parameter. The aim of this retrospective
  study is to examine the extent to which such an application can also be transferred
  to patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
