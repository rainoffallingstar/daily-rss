description: Early cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) diagnosis is essential
  to initiate adequate targeted treatment. Noninvasive diagnostic technologies could
  overcome the need of multiple biopsies and reduce tumor recurrence. To assess performance
  of noninvasive technologies for cSCC diagnostics, 947 relevant records were identified
  through a systematic literature search. Among the 15 selected studies within this
