description: Neurons grow neurites of several tens of micrometers in length, necessitating
  active transport from the cell body by motor proteins. By tracking fluorophores
  as minimally invasive labels, MINFLUX is able to quantify the motion of those proteins
  with nanometer/millisecond resolution. Here we study the substeps of a truncated
  kinesin-1 mutant in primary rat hippocampal neurons, which have so far been mainly
  observed on polymerized microtubules deposited onto glass coverslips. A gentle ...
