description: The superior productivity of C(4) plants is achieved via a metabolic
  C(4) cycle which acts as a CO(2) pump across mesophyll and bundle sheath (BS) cells
  and requires an additional input of energy in the form of ATP. The importance of
  chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like complex (NDH) operating cyclic electron flow
  (CEF) around Photosystem I (PSI) for C(4) photosynthesis has been shown in reverse
  genetics studies but the contribution of CEF and NDH to cell-level electron fluxes
  remained ...
