description: Thrombomodulin (TM) expressed on endothelial cells regulates coagulation.
  Specific nonsense variants in the TM gene, THBD, result in high soluble TM levels
  causing rare bleeding disorder. In contrast, though THBD variants have been associated
  with venous thromboembolism, this association remains controversial. A multigene
  panel was used to diagnose 601 patients with inherited bleeding or thrombotic disorders.
  This resulted in the identification of 8 THBD variants for six patients with ...
