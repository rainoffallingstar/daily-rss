description: The drug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein, encoded by the ABCB1 gene,
  promotes acquired chemoresistance. We explored the presence and clinical relevance
  of circulating cell-free ABCB1 transcripts (cfABCB1^(tx)) in ovarian cancer patients
  (173 longitudinal serum samples from 79 cancer patients) using digital droplet PCR.
  cfABCB1^(tx) were readily detectable at primary diagnosis (median 354 mRNA copies/20
  µl serum), paralleled FIGO-stage and predicted surgical outcome (p = 0.023, ...
