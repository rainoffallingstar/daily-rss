description: Many animals share a lifelong capacity to adapt their growth rates and
  body sizes to changing environmental food supplies. However, the cellular and molecular
  basis underlying this plasticity remains only poorly understood. We therefore studied
  how the sea anemones Nematostella vectensis and Aiptasia (Exaiptasia pallida) respond
  to feeding and starvation. Combining quantifications of body size and cell numbers
  with mathematical modelling, we observed that growth and shrinkage rates ...
