description: Microglia are present throughout the central nervous system and are vital
  in neural repair, nutrition, phagocytosis, immunological regulation, and maintaining
  neuronal function. In a healthy spinal cord, microglia are accountable for immune
  surveillance, however, when a spinal cord injury occurs, the microenvironment drastically
  changes, leading to glial scars and failed axonal regeneration. In this context,
  microglia vary their gene and protein expression during activation, and proliferation
