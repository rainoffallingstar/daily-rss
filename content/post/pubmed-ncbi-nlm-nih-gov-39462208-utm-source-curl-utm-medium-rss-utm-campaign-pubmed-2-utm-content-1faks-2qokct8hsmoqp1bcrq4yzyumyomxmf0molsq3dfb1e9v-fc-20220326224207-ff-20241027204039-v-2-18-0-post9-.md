description: Butafulvenes, together with pentafulvenes and [3]radialenes, form a series
  of constitutional benzene isomers in which aromaticity changes significantly and
  can be strongly substituent dependent. Butafulvene, as a member of this series,
  is frequently proposed to be antiaromatic. Based on butafulvenes Hopf, Zimmerman
  and coworkers first time described, derivatives thereof were synthesized and the
  effects of substituents on both the stability of the intermediate isobenzenes and
  on ...
