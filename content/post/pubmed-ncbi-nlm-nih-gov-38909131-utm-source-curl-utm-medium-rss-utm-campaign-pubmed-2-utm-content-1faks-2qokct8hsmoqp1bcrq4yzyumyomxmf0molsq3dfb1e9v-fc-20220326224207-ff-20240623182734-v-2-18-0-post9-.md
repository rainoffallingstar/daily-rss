description: In a cardiac output (CO) sub-study of the Restrictive versus Liberal
  Fluid Therapy in Major Abdominal Surgery (RELIEF) trial, it was shown that restrictive
  fluid management was associated with lower cardiac index at the end of surgery.
  However, the association of the fluid protocol with intraoperative blood pressure
  was less clear. This paper primarily compares rates of hypotension between the two
  fluid regimens. The haemodynamic effects of these protocols may increase our understanding
