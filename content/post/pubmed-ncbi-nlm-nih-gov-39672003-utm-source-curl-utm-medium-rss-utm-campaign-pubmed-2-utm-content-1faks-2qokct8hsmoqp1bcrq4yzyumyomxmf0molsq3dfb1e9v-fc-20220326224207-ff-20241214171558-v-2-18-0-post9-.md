description: Early-onset pancreatic cancer (EOPC) is usually defined as patients with
  pancreatic cancer before the age of 50 years, which is relatively rare. However,
  the research on EOPC is somewhat obscure, and the specific clinical and molecular
  characteristics of this condition are debated. In this review, we discussed the
  differences between EOPC and late-onset pancreatic cancer (LOPC) or average-onset
  pancreatic cancer (AOPC) with a focus on clinical and molecular characteristics,
  survival outcomes ...
