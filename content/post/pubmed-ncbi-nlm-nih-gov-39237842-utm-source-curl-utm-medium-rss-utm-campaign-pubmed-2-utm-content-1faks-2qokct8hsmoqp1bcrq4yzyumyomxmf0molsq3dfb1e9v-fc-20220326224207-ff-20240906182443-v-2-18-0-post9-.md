description: Individual differences in working memory capacity (WMC) are correlated
  with long-term memory (LTM) differences. Whether this is because high-WMC individuals
  encode more effectively, resulting in better LTM storage, or because they better
  retrieve information from LTM is debated. In two experiments, we used Bayesian-hierarchical
  multinomial modeling to correlate participant-level storage and retrieval processes
  from LTM recall to WMC abilities estimated from operation and symmetry complex ...
