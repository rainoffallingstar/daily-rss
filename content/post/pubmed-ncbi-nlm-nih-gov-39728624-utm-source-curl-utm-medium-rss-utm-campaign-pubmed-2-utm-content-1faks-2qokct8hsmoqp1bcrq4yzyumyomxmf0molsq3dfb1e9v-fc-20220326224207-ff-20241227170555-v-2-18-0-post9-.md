description: High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) remains the most lethal gynecological
  malignancy, and there is still an unmet medical need to deepen basic research on
  its origins and mechanisms of progression. Patient-derived organoids of high-grade
  serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC-PDO) are a powerful model to study the complexity of
  ovarian cancer as they maintain, in vitro, the mutational profile and cellular architecture
  of the cancer tissue. Genetic modifications by lentiviral transduction allow ...
