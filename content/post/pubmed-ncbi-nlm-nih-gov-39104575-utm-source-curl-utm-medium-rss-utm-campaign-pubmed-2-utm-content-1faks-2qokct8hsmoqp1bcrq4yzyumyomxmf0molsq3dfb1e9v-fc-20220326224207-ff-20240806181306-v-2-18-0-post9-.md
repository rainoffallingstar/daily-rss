  transfer and persist as extrachromosomal episomes. A small fraction of vector genomes
  integrate into the host genome, but the theoretical risk of tumorigenesis depends
  on vector regulatory features. A mouse model was used to investigate integration
  profiles of an AAV serotype 5 (AAV5) vector produced using Sf and HEK293 cells that
