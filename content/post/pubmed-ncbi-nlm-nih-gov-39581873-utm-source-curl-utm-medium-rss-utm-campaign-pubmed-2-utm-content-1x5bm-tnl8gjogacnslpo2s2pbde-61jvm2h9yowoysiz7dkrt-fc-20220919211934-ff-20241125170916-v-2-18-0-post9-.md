description: Cell-cell communication plays a critical role in maintaining normal biological
  functions, regulating development and differentiation, and controlling immune responses.
  The rapid development of single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics
  sequencing (ST-seq) technologies provides essential data support for in-depth and
  comprehensive analysis of cell-cell communication. However, ST-seq data often contain
  incomplete data and systematic biases, which may reduce the accuracy and ...
