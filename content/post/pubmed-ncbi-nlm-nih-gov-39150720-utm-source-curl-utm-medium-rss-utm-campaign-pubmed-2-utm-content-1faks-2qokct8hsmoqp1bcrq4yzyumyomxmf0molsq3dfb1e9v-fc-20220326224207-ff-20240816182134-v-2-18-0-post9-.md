description: Recent advancements in ultrashort and intense X-ray sources have enabled
  the utilisation of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) as a probing technique
  for monitoring photoinduced dynamics in molecular systems. To account for dynamic
  phenomena like non-adiabatic transitions across the relevant electronic state manifold,
  a time-dependent framework is crucial. Here, we introduce a fully time-dependent
  approach for calculating transient RIXS spectra using wavepacket dynamics ...
