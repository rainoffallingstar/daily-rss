description: Sepsis is a life-threatening syndrome triggered by infection and accompanied
  by high mortality, with antimicrobial resistances (AMRs) further escalating clinical
  challenges. The rapid and reliable detection of causative pathogens and AMRs are
  key factors for fast and appropriate treatment, in order to improve outcomes in
  septic patients. However, current sepsis diagnostics based on blood culture is limited
  by low sensitivity and specificity while current molecular approaches fail to ...
