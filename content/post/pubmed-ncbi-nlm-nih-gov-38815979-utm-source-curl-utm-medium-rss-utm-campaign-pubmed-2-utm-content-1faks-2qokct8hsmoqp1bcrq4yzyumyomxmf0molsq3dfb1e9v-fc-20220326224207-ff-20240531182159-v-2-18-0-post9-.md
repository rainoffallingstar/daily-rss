description: Lubricin, an intrinsically disordered glycoprotein, plays a pivotal role
  in facilitating smooth movement and ensuring the enduring functionality of synovial
  joints. The central domain of this protein serves as a source of this excellent
  lubrication and is characterized by its highly glycosylated, negatively charged,
  and disordered structure. However, the influence of O-glycans on the viscosity of
  lubricin remains unclear. In this study, we employ molecular dynamics simulations
