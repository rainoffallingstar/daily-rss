description: Recent genomic studies have allowed the subdivision of intracranial ependymomas
  into molecularly distinct groups with highly specific clinical features and outcomes.
  The majority of supratentorial ependymomas (ST-EPN) harbor ZFTA-RELA fusions which
  were designated, in general, as an intermediate risk tumor variant. However, molecular
  prognosticators within ST-EPN ZFTA-RELA have not been determined yet. Here, we performed
  methylation-based DNA profiling and transcriptome RNA sequencing ...
