description: Kinases are critical regulators of cellular function that are commonly
  implicated in the mechanisms underlying disease. Most drugs that target kinases
  are molecules that inhibit their catalytic activity, but here we used chemically
  induced proximity to convert kinase inhibitors into activators of therapeutic genes.
  We synthesized bivalent molecules that link ligands of the transcription factor
  B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) to inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). These
  molecules ...
