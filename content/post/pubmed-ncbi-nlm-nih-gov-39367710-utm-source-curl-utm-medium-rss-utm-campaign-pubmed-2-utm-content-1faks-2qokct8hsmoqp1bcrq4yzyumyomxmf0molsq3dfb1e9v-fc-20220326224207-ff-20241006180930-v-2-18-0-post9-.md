description: Despite established links between prenatal nutritional deprivation and
  impaired offspring growth, the underlying dynamics and potential moderators remain
  largely unexplored. This study investigates the dynamics underlying Ramadan during
  pregnancy and its associations with children's linear growth, using data from the
  Indonesian Family Life Survey (1993 - 2015). We exploit Ramadan during pregnancy
  as a natural experiment, separating exposure from maternal background characteristics
  and season ...
