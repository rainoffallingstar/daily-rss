description: Members of the casein kinase 1 (CK1) family are important regulators
  of multiple signaling pathways. CK1α is a well-known negative regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway, which promotes the degradation of β-catenin via its phosphorylation of
  Ser45. In contrast, the closest paralog of CK1α, CK1α-like, is a poorly characterized
  kinase of unknown function. In this study we show that the deletion of CK1α, but
  not CK1α-like, resulted in a strong activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. ...
