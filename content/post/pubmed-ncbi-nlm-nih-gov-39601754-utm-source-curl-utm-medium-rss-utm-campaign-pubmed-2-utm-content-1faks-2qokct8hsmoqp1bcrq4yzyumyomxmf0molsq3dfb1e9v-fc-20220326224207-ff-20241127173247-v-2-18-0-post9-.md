description: Translational control is crucial for well-balanced cellular function
  and viability of organisms. Different mechanisms have evolved to up- and down-regulate
  protein synthesis, including 3' untranslated region (UTR)-mediated translation repression.
  RNA binding proteins or microRNAs interact with regulatory sequence elements located
  in the 3' UTR and interfere most often with the rate-limiting initiation step of
  translation. Dysregulation of post-transcriptional gene expression leads to ...
