description: Transcription of transfer RNA (tRNA) genes by RNA polymerase (Pol) III
  requires the general transcription factor IIIC (TFIIIC), which recognizes intragenic
  A-box and B-box DNA motifs of type II gene promoters. However, the underlying mechanism
  has remained elusive, in part due to missing structural information for A-box recognition.
  In this study, we use single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and
  single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to ...
