description: Familial Dysautonomia (FD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused
  by a splice site mutation in the gene ELP1, which disproportionally affects neurons.
  While classically characterized by deficits in sensory and autonomic neurons, neuronal
  defects in the central nervous system have also been described. Although, ELP1 expression
  remains high in the normal developing and adult cerebellum, its role in cerebellar
  development is unknown. To explore the role of Elp1 in the cerebellum, we knocked
