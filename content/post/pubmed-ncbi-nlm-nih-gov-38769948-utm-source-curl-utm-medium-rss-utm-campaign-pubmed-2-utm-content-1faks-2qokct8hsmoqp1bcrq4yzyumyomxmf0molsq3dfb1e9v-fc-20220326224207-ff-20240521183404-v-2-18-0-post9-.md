description: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
  represent first-line standard of care in unresectable EGFR mutation-positive (EGFRm+)
  non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, 10-20% of patients with EGFRm+ NSCLC
  have uncommon EGFR variants, defined as mutations other than L858R substitutions
  or exon 19 deletions. NSCLC harboring uncommon EGFR mutations may demonstrate lower
  sensitivity to targeted agents than NSCLC with L858R or exon 19 deletion ...
