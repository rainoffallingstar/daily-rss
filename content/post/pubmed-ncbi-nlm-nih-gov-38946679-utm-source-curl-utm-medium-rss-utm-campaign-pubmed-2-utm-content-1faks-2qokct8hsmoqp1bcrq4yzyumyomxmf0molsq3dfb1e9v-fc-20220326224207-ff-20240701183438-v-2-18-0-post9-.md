description: Small-scale robots offer significant potential in minimally invasive
  medical procedures. Due to the nature of soft biological tissues, however, robots
  are exposed to complex environments with various challenges in locomotion, which
  is essential to overcome for useful medical tasks. A single mini-robot often provides
  insufficient force on slippery biological surfaces to carry medical instruments,
  such as a fluid catheter or an electrical wire. Here, for the first time, a team
