description: Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) rapidly clear lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) from the bloodstream and establish intimate contact with immune cells. However,
  their role in regulating liver inflammation remains poorly understood. We show that
  LSECs modify their chemokine expression profile driven by LPS or interferon-γ (IFN-γ),
  resulting in the production of the myeloid- or lymphoid-attracting chemokines CCL2
  and CXCL10, respectively, which accumulate in the serum of LPS-challenged ...
