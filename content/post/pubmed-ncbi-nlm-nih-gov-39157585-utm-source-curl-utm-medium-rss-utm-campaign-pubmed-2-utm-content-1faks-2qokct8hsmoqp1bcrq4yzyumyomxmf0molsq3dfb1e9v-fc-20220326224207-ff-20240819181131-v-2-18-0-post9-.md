description: The discovery of functional long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) changed their
  initial concept as transcriptional noise. LncRNAs have been identified as regulators
  of multiple biological processes, including chromatin structure, gene expression,
  splicing, mRNA degradation, and translation. However, functional studies of lncRNAs
  are hindered by the usual lack of phenotypes upon deletion or inhibition. Here,
  we used Drosophila imaginal discs as a model system to identify lncRNAs involved
