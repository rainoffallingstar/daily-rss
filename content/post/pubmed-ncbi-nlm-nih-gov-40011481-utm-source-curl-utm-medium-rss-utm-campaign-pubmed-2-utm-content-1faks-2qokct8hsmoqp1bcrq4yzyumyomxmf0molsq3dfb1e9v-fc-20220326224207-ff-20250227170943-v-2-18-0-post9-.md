description: The purpose of this prospective case-control study is to investigate
  differences in quantitative autofluorescence (qAF) in clinically affected and unaffected
  eyes of patients with inactive posterior uveitis compared to healthy, age-matched
  controls. Patients with posterior uveitis and healthy controls were imaged using
  fundus autofluorescence (488 nm excitation; Spectralis HRA + OCT; Heidelberg Engineering)
  to measure qAF values using the proprietary HEYEX software. Mean background ...
