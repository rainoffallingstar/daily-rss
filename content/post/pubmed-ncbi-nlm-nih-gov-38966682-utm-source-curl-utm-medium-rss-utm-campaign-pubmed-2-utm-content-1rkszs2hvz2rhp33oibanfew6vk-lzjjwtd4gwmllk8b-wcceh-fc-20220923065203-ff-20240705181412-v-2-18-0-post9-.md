description: Antibrush border antibody (ABBA) disease is a rare cause of kidney disease
  characterized by progressive renal tubular injury associated with immune complex
  deposition along the basement membranes of the proximal tubule and circulating autoantibodies
  to brush border antigens. Several antigens have been identified as targets of autoantibodies
  in this disease, including low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 2 (LRP2),
  cubilin, and amnionless proteins. We present 9 patients from 2 ...
