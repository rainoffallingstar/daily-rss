description: '(1) Background: Currently, no data are available in the literature investigating
  the influence of radiotherapy (RT) on endotracheal intubation success in patients
  with esophageal cancer. This study aims to evaluate the impact of RT on endotracheal
  intubation quality metrics in patients with esophageal cancer. (2) Methods: Patients
  with esophageal cancer who underwent RT followed by surgery between 2012 and 2023
  at the University Hospital Heidelberg, Germany, were retrospectively analyzed. ...'
