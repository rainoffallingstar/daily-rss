description: Post-transcriptional tRNA modifications contribute to the decoding efficiency
  of tRNAs by supporting codon recognition and tRNA stability. Recent work shows that
  the molecular and cellular functions of tRNA modifications and tRNA-modifying-enzymes
  are linked to brain development and neurological disorders. Lack of these modifications
  affects codon recognition and decoding rate, promoting protein aggregation and translational
  stress response pathways with toxic consequences to the cell. In ...
