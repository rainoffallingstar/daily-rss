description: Federated learning is a renowned technique for utilizing decentralized
  data while preserving privacy. However, real-world applications often face challenges
  like partially labeled datasets, where only a few locations have certain expert
  annotations, leaving large portions of unlabeled data unused. Leveraging these could
  enhance transformer architectures' ability in regimes with small and diversely annotated
  sets. We conduct the largest federated cardiac CT analysis to date (n = 8, 104)
