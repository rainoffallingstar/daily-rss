description: Imaging, particularly computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance
  imaging (MRI), plays a central role in the diagnostics, treatment planning and follow-up
  of aortic diseases. While ultrasound is often used for the initial assessment, CT
  enables rapid and comprehensive imaging of the aorta. The MRI is a radiation-free
  and when necessary, contrast agent-free alternative and provides functional imaging
  methods. Positron emission tomography (PET) is particularly relevant for ...
