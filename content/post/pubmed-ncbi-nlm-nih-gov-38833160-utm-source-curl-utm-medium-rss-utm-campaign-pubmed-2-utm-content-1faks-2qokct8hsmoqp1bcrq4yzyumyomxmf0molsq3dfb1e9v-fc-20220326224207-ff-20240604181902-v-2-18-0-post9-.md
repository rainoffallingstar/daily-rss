description: This article is intended to highlight one of the key roles in endoprosthetic
  treatment with artificial implants and the extension of service life. Like every
  joint, artificial joints are subject to the physical laws of friction and wear-in
  short, tribology. Material pairings, surfaces and mechanisms of action in particular
  play a decisive role here. The special features and current findings relating to
  the three largest synovial joints (hip, knee and shoulder) will be discussed in
  detail ...
