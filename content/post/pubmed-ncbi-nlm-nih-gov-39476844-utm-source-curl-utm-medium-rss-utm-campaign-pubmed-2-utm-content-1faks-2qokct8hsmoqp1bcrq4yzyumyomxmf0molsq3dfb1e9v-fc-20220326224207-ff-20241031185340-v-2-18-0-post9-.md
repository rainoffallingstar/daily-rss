description: Transcriptional induction coincides with the formation of various chromatin
  topologies. Strong evidence supports that gene activation is accompanied by a general
  increase in promoter-enhancer interactions. However, it remains unclear how these
  topological changes are coordinated across time and space during transcriptional
  activation. Here, we combine chromatin conformation capture with transcription and
  chromatin profiling during an embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation time course
