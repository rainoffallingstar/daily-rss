description: 'Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) presents in two clinically distinct
  subtypes: large duct (LD-iCCA) and small duct (SD-iCCA). These subtypes exhibit
  significant molecular, genetic, and histopathological differences that impact patient
  prognosis and treatment responsiveness. This review advocates for a subtype-specific
  approach to iCCA research and clinical management, including tailored therapeutic
  strategies that consider distinct genetic profiles and tumor microenvironments.
