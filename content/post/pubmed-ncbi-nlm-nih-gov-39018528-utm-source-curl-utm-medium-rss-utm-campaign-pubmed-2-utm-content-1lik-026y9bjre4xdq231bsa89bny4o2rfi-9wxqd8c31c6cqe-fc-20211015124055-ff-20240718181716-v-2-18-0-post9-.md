description: KRAS gain-of-function mutations are frequently observed in sporadic arteriovenous
  malformations. The mechanisms underlying the progression of such KRAS-driven malformations
  are still incompletely understood, and no treatments for the condition are approved.
  Here, we show the effectiveness of sotorasib, a specific KRAS G12C inhibitor, in
  reducing the volume of vascular malformations and improving survival in two mouse
  models carrying a mosaic Kras G12C mutation. We then administered sotorasib ...
