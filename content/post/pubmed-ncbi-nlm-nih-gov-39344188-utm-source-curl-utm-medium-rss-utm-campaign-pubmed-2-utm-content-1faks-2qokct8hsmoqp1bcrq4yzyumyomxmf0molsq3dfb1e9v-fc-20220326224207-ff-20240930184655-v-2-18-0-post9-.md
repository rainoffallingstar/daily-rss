description: Coronary anomalies occur in 0.2% to 1.2% of the population, with the
  anomalous aortic origin of the coronary arteries accounting for one third of these
  cases. Clinical presentations can vary from asymptomatic to experiencing cardiac
  symptoms and sudden death, making diagnosis challenging. In this report, we present
  a novel artificial intelligence-supervised vectorcardiographic analysis and the
  subsequent successful surgical treatment of a young ...
