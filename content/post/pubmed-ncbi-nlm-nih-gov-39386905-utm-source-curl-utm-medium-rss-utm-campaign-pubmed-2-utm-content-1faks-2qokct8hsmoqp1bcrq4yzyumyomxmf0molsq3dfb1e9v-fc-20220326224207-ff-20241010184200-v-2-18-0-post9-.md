description: The reactivity of unprecedented CCC-NHC Au(iii) pincer complexes has
  been investigated, employing a novel methodology for their preparation. Notably,
  this marks the inaugural case of CCC-NHC Au(iii) pincer complexes with a central
  aryl moiety where the two arms of the pincer ligand consist of N-heterocyclic carbenes
  (NHC). The stability conferred by the CCC-NHC ligand facilitated the isolation of
  elusive Au(iii) species, encompassing Au(iii)-formate, Au(iii)-F, Au(iii)-Me, and
