description: V-domain Ig-containing suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA) is a unique
  immune checkpoint protein, which was reported to display both receptor and ligand
  activities. However, the mechanisms of regulation of VISTA activity and functions
  by factors of tumour microenvironment (TME) remain unclear and understanding these
  processes is required in order to develop successful personalised cancer immunotherapeutic
  strategies and approaches. Here we report for the very first time that VISTA ...
