title: I agree with Dean Eckles that this study, “Effects of Political versus Expert
  Messaging on Vaccination Intentions of Trump Voters,” is too noisy to be useful.  When
  will we reach the point where researchers can catch this sort of problem with their
  own designs, rather than just jumping in, gathering data, and inappropriately drawing
  conclusions from random patterns that happen to be “statistically significant” in
  the data?
