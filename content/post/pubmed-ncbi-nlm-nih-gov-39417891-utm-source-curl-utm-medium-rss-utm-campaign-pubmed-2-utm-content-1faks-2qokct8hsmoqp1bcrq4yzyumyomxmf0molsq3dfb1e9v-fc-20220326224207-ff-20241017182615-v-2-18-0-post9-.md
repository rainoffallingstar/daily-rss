description: Reward system dysfunction is implicated in the pathogenesis of major
  psychiatric disorders. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify
  genes that influence activation strength of brain regions within the extended reward
  system in humans. A homogeneous sample of 214 participants was genotyped and underwent
  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). All subjects performed the 'desire-reason
  dilemma' (DRD) paradigm allowing systematic investigation of ...
