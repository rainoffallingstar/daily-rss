description: The majority of bacteriophage diversity remains uncharacterized, and
  new intriguing mechanisms of their biology are being continually described. Members
  of some phage lineages, such as the Crassvirales, repurpose stop codons to encode
  an amino acid by using alternate genetic codes. Here, we investigated the prevalence
  of stop codon reassignment in phage genomes and its subsequent impacts on functional
  annotation. We predicted 76 genomes within INPHARED and 712 vOTUs from the Unified
  Human ...
