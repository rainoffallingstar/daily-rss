description: GABA(B) receptors play a modulatory role in the mechanisms underlying
  drug addiction, sleep problems, and aging; however, there are few studies addressing
  their relationship. Therefore, this study aimed to examine whether blockade of these
  receptors affects methamphetamine (METH) reward memory in adult and adolescent rapid-eye
  movement sleep deprived (RSD) rats. Adolescent and adult male Wistar rats were subjected
  to RSD for seven days. They were then conditioned to receive ...
