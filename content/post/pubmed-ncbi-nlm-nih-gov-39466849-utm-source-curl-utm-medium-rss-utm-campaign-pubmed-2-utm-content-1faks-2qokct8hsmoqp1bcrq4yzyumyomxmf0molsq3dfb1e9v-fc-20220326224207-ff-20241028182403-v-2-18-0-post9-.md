description: Centrosomes are the major microtubule organizing centers of animal cells.
  Supernumerary centrosomes are a common feature of human tumors and associated with
  karyotype abnormalities and aggressive disease, but whether they are cause or consequence
  of cancer remains controversial. Here, we analyzed the consequences of centrosome
  amplification by generating transgenic mice in which centrosome numbers can be increased
  by overexpression of the structural centrosome protein STIL. We show that ...
