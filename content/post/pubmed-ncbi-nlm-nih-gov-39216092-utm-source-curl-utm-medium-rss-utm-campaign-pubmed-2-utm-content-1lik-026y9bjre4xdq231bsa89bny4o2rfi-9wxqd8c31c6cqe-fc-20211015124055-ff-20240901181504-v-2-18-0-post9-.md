description: 'CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with heart failure with moderate to severe
  functional mitral regurgitation who received medical therapy, the addition of transcatheter
  mitral-valve repair led to a lower rate of first or recurrent hospitalization for
  heart failure or cardiovascular death and a lower rate of first or recurrent hospitalization
  for heart failure at 24 months and better health status at 12 months than medical
  therapy alone. (Funded by Abbott Laboratories; RESHAPE-HF2 ClinicalTrials.gov...
