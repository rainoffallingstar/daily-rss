description: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into radiotherapy has
  advanced significantly during the past 5 years, especially in terms of automating
  key processes like organ at risk delineation and treatment planning. These innovations
  have enhanced consistency, accuracy, and efficiency in clinical practice. Magnetic
