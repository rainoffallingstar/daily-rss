description: The increasing number of patients with metal implants raises concerns
  about metal-induced geometric distortions (MD) in MR-guided treatments. This study
  proposes a method for three-dimensional quantification of MD and evaluates its accuracy
  and reliability. A 3D lattice phantom was designed and measured with two sequences
  (VIBE and SPACE) and two implants (crown-supported-dental-implant and stainless-steel-bracket).
  Automated detection of displacement of 9360 crossing points caused by MD ...
