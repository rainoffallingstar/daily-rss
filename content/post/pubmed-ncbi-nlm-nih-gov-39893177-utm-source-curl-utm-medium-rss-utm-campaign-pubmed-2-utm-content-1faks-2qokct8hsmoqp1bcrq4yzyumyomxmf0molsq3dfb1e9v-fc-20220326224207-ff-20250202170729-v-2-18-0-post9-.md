description: T cell receptor-engineered T cells (TCR-T) could be advantageous in glioblastoma
  by allowing safe and ubiquitous targeting of the glioblastoma-derived peptidome.
  Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z1 (PTPRZ1), is a clinically targetable
  glioblastoma antigen associated with glioblastoma cell stemness. Here, we identify
  a therapeutic HLA-A*02-restricted PTPRZ1-reactive TCR retrieved from a vaccinated
  glioblastoma patient. Single-cell sequencing of primary brain tumors shows ...
