description: Bicuspid aortic valfves (BAV) are a relatively common cardiac abnormality,
  with an associated risk of aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation and aortopathy.
  First-line diagnosis is via transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), which may be impacted
  by valve calcification and operator variability. Electrocardiogram-gated computed
  tomography (CT) offers an alternative form of assessment. The aim of this systematic
  review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of TTE versus
