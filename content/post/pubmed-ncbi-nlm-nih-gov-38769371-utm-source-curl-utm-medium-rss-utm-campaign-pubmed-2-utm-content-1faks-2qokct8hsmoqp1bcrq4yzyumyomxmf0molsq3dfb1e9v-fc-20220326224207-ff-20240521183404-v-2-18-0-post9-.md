  disorders and can recapitulate brain volume alterations such as microcephaly. To
  monitor organoid growth, brightfield microscopy images are frequently used and evaluated
  manually which is time-consuming and prone to observer-bias. Recent software applications
  for organoid evaluation address this issue using classical or AI-based methods.
