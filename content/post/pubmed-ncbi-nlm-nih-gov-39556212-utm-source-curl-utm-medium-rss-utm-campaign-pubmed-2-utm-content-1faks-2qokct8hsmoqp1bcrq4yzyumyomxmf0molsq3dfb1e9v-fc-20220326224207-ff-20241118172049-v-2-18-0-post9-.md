description: Substantial nerve lesions almost always lead to persistent functional
  deficits, even with ideal treatment. Nerve lesions commonly occur in young patients,
  are often part of complex injuries, and are repeatedly diagnosed and treated with
  delay. Functional outcome crucially depends on early and adequate treatment. The
  aim of surgical treatment is a precise and tension-free microsurgical restoration
  of nerve continuity in a vital and healthy tissue environment. Adequate microsurgical
