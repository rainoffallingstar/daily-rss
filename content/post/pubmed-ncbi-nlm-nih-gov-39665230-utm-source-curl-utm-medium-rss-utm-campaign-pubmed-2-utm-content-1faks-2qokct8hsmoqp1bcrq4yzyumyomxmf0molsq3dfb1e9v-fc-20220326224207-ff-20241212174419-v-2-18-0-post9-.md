description: Single-cell MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) of lipids and metabolites
  >200 Da has recently come to the forefront of biomedical research and chemical biology.
  However, cell-targeting and metabolome-preserving methods for analysis of low mass,
  hydrophilic metabolites (<200 Da) in large cell populations are lacking. Here, the
  PRISM-MS (PRescan Imaging for Small Molecule - Mass Spectrometry) mass-guided MSI
  workflow is presented, which enables space-efficient single cell lipid and ...
