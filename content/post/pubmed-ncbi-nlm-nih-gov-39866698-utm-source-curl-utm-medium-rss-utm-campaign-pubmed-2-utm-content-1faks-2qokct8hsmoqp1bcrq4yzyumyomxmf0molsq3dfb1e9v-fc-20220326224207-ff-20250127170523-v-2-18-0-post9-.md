description: The design of metalloproteins allows us to better understand metal complexation
  in proteins and the resulting function. In this study, we incorporated a Cu^(2+)-binding
  site into a natural protein domain, the 58 amino acid c-Crk-SH3, to create a miniaturized
  superoxide dismutase model, termed SO1. The resulting low complexity metalloprotein
  was characterized for structure and function by circular dichroism and UV spectroscopy
  as well as EPR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. The ...
