description: Microorganisms must distribute their limited resources among different
  physiological functions, including those that do not directly contribute to growth.
  In this study, we investigate the allocation of resources to flagellar swimming,
  the most prominent and biosynthetically costly of such cellular functions in bacteria.
  Although the growth-dependence of flagellar gene expression in peritrichously flagellated
  Escherichia coli is well known, the underlying physiological limitations and ...
