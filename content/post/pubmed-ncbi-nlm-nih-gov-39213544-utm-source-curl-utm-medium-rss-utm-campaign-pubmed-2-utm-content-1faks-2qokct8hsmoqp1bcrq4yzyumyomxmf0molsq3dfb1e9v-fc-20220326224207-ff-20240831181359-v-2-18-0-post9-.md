description: On 9 October 2022, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO)
  reported the observation of the very early TeV afterglow of the brightest-of-all-time
  gamma-ray burst 221009A, recording the highest photon statistics in the TeV band
  ever obtained from a gamma-ray burst. We use this unique observation to place stringent
  constraints on the energy dependence of the speed of light in vacuum, a manifestation
  of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) predicted by some quantum gravity ...
