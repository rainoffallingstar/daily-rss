description: Cardiac aging is an intricate and multifaceted process with considerable
  impact on public health, especially given the global demographic shift towards aged
  populations. This review discusses structural, cellular and functional changes associated
  with cardiac aging and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Key
  molecular mediators are considered within the framework of the established hallmarks
  of aging, with particular attention to promising therapeutic candidates. We ...
