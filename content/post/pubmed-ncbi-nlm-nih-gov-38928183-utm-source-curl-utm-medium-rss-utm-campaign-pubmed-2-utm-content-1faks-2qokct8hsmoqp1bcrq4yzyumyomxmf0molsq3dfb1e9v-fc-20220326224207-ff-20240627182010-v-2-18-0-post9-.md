description: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition with a rising disease burden worldwide.
  It is a multifactorial disease and is defined as a dysregulated host response to
  infection. Neutrophils have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of sepsis
  by exacerbating inflammation. However, the exact effector mechanism of action still
  remains a mystery. Changes in the glycosylation pattern of the immunoglobulin G
  (IgG) Fc region are described for several diseases including meningococcal sepsis.
