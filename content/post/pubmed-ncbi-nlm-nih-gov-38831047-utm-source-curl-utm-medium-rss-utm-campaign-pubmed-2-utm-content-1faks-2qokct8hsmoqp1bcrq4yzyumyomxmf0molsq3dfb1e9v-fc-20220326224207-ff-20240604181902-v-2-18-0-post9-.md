description: Elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) levels should be
  expected in about half of all patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Since those
  patients are at risk of increased morbidity and mortality, often attributable to
  cardiac causes, an adequate work-up of the underlying etiology is required. This
  can only be achieved by a team of cardiologists and neurologists. Since underlying
  causes of hs-cTn elevation in AIS patients are diverse, often atypical or silent
