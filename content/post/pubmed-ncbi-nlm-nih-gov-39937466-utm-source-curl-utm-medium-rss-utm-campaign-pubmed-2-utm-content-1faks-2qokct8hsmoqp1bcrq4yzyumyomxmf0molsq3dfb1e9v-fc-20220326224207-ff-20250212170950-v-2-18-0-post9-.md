description: Conformational sampling is nowadays a standard routine in computational
  chemistry. Within this work, we present a method to perform conformational sampling
  for systems exposed to elevated pressures within the CREST program, allowing us
  to model pressure-induced changes of molecular ensembles and structural parameters.
  For this purpose, we extend the molecular Hamiltonian with the PV (pressure times
  volume) term, using the solvent-accessible volume. The volume computation is performed
