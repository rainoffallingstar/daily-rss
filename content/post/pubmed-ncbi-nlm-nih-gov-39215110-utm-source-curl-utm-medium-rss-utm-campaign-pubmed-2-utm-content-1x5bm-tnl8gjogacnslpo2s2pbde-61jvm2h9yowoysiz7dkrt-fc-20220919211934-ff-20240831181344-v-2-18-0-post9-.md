description: Alzheimer's disease is the predominant form of dementia, and disulfidptosis
  is the latest reported mode of cell death that impacts various disease processes.
  This study used bioinformatics to analyze genes associated with disulfidptosis in
  Alzheimer's disease comprehensively. Based on the public datasets, the differentially
  expressed genes associated with disulfidptosis were identified, and immune cell
  infiltration was investigated through correlation analysis. Subsequently, hub genes
