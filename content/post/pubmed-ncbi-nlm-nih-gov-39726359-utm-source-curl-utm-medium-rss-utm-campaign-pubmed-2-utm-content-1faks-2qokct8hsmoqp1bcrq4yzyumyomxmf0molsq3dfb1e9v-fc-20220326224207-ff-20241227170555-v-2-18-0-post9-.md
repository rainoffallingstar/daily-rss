description: Ebola virus (EBOV) transcription is essentially regulated via dynamic
  dephosphorylation of its viral transcription activator VP30 by the host phosphatase
  PP2A. The nucleoprotein NP has emerged as a third key player in the regulation of
  this process by recruiting both the regulatory subunit B56 of PP2A and its substrate
  VP30 to initiate VP30 dephosphorylation and hence viral transcription. Both binding
  sites are located in close proximity to each other in NP's C-terminal disordered
  region. ...
