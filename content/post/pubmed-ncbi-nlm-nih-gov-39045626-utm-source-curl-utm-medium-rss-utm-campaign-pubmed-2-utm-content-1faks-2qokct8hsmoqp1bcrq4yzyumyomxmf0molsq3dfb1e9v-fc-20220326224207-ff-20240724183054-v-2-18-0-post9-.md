description: Nucleosidic diarylethenes (DAEs) have evolved from an emerging class
  of photochromes into a well-established option for integrating photochromic functionalities
  into biological systems. However, a comprehensive understanding of how chemical
  structure influences their photochromic properties remains essential. While structural
  features, such as an inverse connection between the aryl residues and the ethene
  bridge, are well-documented for classical DAEs, their application to nucleosidic
  DAEs ...
