description: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems may personalise radiotherapy by
  assessing complex and multifaceted patient data and predicting tumour and normal
  tissue responses to radiotherapy. Here we describe three distinct generations of
  AI systems, namely personalised radiotherapy based on pretreatment data, response-driven
  radiotherapy and dynamically optimised radiotherapy. Finally, we discuss the main
  challenges in clinical translation of AI systems for radiotherapy ...
