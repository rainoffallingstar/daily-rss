description: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a type of double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid
  virus belonging to the herpesviridae family. Following a primary infection, the
  virus becomes latent in various types of white blood cells. Cytomegalovirus infection
  can remain latent or become active, especially in immunocompromised individuals,
  such as those undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), where CMV
  reactivation can occur. In this context, CMV infection is common and associated
