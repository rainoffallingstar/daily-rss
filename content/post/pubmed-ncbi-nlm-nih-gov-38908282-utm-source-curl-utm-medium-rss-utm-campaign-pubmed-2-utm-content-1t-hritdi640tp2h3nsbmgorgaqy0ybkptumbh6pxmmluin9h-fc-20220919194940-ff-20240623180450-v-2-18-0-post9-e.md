description: Improving the separation efficiency of carriers is an important part
  of enhancing photocatalytic activity. Herein, we successfully decorated metallic
  1T phase tungsten disulfide (1T-WS(2)) on the surface of zinc indium sulfide (ZnIn(2)S(4))
  and investigated the synergistic effect of 1T-WS(2) on ZnIn(2)S(4). The characterization
  results show that 1T-WS(2) improves the light absorption capacity and utilization
  efficiency, increases the catalytic active site, improves the photogenerated ...
