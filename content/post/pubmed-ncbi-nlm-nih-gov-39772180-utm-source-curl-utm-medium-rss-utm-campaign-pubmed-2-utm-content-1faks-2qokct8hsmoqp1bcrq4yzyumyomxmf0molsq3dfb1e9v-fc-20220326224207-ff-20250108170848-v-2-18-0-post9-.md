description: The study of hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication in cell culture is mainly
  based on cloned viral isolates requiring adaptation for efficient replication in
  Huh7 hepatoma cells. The analysis of wild-type (WT) isolates was enabled by the
  expression of SEC14L2 and by inhibitors targeting deleterious host factors. Here,
  we aimed to optimize cell culture models to allow infection with HCV from patient
  sera. We used Huh7-Lunet cells ectopically expressing SEC14L2, CD81, and a GFP reporter
  with ...
