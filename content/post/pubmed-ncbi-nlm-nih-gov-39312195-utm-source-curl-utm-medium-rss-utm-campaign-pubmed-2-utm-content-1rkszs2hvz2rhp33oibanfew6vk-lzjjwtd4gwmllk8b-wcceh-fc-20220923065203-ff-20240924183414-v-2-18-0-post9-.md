description: MYC deregulation occurs in the majority of multiple myeloma (MM) cases
  and is associated with progression and worse prognosis. Enhanced MYC expression
  occurs in about 70% of MM patients, but it is known to be driven by translocation
  or amplification events in only ~40% of myelomas. Here, we used CRISPR interference
  (CRISPRi) to uncover an epigenetic mechanism of MYC regulation whereby increased
  accessibility of a plasma cell-type specific enhancer leads to increased MYC expression.
