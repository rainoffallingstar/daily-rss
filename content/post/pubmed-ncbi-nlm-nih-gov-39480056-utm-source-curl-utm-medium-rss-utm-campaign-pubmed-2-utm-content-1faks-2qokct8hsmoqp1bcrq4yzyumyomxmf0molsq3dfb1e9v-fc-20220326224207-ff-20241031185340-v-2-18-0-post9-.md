description: Earlier scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies have shown that nitrogen
  forms square c(2x2) islands on Cu(100) surfaces, the assembly of which depends on
  coverage. Recent calculations have revealed that adatom-adatom interactions are
  compatible with the formation of square c(2x2) islands. The pair distribution of
  these islands is a topic of the current investigation. In addition, the domain structure
  of islands found recently in STM experiments is discussed and explained using two
