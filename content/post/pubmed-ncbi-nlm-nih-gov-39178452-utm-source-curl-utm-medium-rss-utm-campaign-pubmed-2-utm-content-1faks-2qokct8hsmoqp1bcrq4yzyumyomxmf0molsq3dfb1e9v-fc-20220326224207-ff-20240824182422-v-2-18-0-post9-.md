description: In this Letter we try to search for signals generated by ultraheavy dark
  matter at the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) data. We look
  for possible γ rays by dark matter annihilation or decay from 16 dwarf spheroidal
  galaxies in the field of view of the LHAASO. Dwarf spheroidal galaxies are among
  the most promising targets for indirect detection of dark matter that have low fluxes
  of astrophysical γ-ray background while having large amount of dark matter. By analyzing
