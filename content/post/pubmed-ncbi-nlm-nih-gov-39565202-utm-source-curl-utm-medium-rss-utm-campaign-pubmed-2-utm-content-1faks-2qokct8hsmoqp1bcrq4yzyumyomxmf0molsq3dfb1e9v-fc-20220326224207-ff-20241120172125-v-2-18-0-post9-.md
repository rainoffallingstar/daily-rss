description: InterPro (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro) is a freely accessible resource
  for the classification of protein sequences into families. It integrates predictive
  models, known as signatures, from multiple member databases to classify sequences
  into families and predict the presence of domains and significant sites. The InterPro
  database provides annotations for over 200 million sequences, ensuring extensive
  coverage of UniProtKB, the standard repository of protein sequences, and includes
  mappings ...
