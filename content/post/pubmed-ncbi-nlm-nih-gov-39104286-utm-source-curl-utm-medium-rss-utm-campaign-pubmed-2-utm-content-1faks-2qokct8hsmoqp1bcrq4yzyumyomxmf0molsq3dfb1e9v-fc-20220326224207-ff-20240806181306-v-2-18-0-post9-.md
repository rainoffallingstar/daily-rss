description: Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are a promising
  thermoelectric material with high power factors after chemical p- or n-doping. Understanding
  the impact of dopant counterions on charge transport and thermoelectric properties
  of nanotube networks is essential to further optimize doping methods and to develop
  better dopants. This work utilizes ion-exchange doping to systematically vary the
  size of counterions in thin films of small and large diameter, ...
