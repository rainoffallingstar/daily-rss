description: Systems with multiple photoswitchable units in one molecule have attracted
  considerable attention in the past years as they are useful for a broad variety
  of possible applications. Especially, linked azobenzenes sharing one benzene ring
  are of high interest since their direct linkage introduces an additional photoswitchable
  unit at only small increase in molecular weight. In this spirit, linear oligoazobenzenes
  had been synthesized, though their photochemical properties have only ...
