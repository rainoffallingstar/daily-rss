description: Thrombotic complications due to platelet hyperreactivity are a major
  cause of death in patients undergoing chemotherapy. However, the underlying mechanisms
  are not fully understood. Herein, using human and GSDME-/- mouse platelets, we showed
  that GSDME is functionally expressed in anucleate platelets and GSDME-mediated pyroptosis,
  a newly identified form of cell death in mammalian nucleated cells, contributes
  to platelet hyperactivity in cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Cisplatin or ...
