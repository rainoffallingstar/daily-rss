description: Myelodysplastic syndromes/neoplasms (MDS) are clonal hematologic disorders
  characterized by morphologic abnormalities of myeloid cells and peripheral cytopenias.
  While genetic abnormalities underlie the pathogenesis of these disorders and their
  heterogeneity, current classifications of MDS rely predominantly on morphology.
  We performed genomic profiling of 3,233 patients with MDS or related disorders to
  delineate molecular subtypes and define their clinical implications. Gene ...
