description: The retrosynthetic design and synthesis of three unprecedented doubly
  N-confused porphyrinoids with tunable aromaticity are reported. The controlled modification
  of the type of oxidant (chloranil vs. DDQ) led to the isolation of cross-conjugated
  doubly N-confused porphyrinoid 7 (upon chloranil oxidation) and Hϋckel aromatic
  porphyrinoid 8, while DDQ oxidation led to the [16]π Hϋckel-antiaromatic porphyrinoid
  9. All three hybrid N-confused porphyrinoids 7-9 have been thoroughly characterized
