description: Duplications of the Xq28,distal locus have been described in male and
  female patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) or intellectual disability. The Xq28,distal
  locus spans eight protein-coding genes (F8, CMC4, MTCP1, BRCC3, VBP1, FUNDC2, CLIC2,
  and RAB39B) and is flanked by recurrent genomic breakpoints. Thus, the issue of
  which gene/s at this locus is/are relevant in terms of SCZ pathogenesis remains
  unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of rare and ...
