description: Biological networks serve a crucial role in elucidating intricate biological
  processes. While interspecies environmental interactions have been extensively studied,
  the exploration of gene interactions within species, particularly among individual
  microorganisms, is less developed. The increasing amount of microbiome genomic data
  necessitates a more nuanced analysis of microbial genome structures and functions.
  In this context, we introduce a complex structure using higher-order network ...
