description: The Parkinson's disease-linked kinase, PINK1, is a short-lived protein
  that undergoes cleavage upon mitochondrial import leading to its proteasomal degradation.
  Under depolarizing conditions, it accumulates on mitochondria where it becomes activated,
  phosphorylating both ubiquitin and the ubiquitin E3 ligase Parkin, at Ser^(65).
  Our experiments reveal that in retinal pigment epithelial cells, only a fraction
  of PINK1 becomes stabilized after depolarization by electron transport chain ...
