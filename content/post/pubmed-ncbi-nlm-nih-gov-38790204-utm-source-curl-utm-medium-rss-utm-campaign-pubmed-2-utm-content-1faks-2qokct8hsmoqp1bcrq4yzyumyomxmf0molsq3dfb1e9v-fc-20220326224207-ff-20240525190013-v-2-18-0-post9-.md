description: Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a powerful tool for biomedical
  research, but their production presents challenges and safety concerns. Yamanaka
  and Takahashi revolutionised the field by demonstrating that somatic cells could
  be reprogrammed into pluripotent cells by overexpressing four key factors for a
  sufficient time. iPSCs are typically generated using viruses or virus-based methods,
  which have drawbacks such as vector persistence, risk of insertional mutagenesis,
