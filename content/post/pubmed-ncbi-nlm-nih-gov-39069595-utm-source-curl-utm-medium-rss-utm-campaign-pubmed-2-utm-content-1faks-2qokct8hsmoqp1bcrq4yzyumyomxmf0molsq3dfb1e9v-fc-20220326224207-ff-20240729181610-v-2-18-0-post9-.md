description: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has been mainly described from a
  risk perspective, with a focus on endogenous, exogenous, and temporal risk factors
  that can interact to facilitate lethal outcomes. Here we discuss the limitations
  that this risk-based paradigm may have, using two of the major risk factors for
  SIDS, prone sleep position and bed-sharing, as examples. Based on a multipronged
  theoretical model encompassing evolutionary theory, developmental biology, and cultural
  mismatch ...
