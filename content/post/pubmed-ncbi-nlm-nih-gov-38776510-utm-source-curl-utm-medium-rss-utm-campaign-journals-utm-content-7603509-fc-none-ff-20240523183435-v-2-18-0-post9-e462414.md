description: The introduction of BTK inhibitors and BCL2 antagonists to the treatment
  of chronic lymphocytic leukemia has revolutionized therapy and improved patient
  outcomes. These agents have replaced chemoimmunotherapy as standard of care. Despite
  this progress, a new group of patients is currently emerging, which has become refractory
  or intolerant to both classes of agents, creating an unmet medical need. Here, we
