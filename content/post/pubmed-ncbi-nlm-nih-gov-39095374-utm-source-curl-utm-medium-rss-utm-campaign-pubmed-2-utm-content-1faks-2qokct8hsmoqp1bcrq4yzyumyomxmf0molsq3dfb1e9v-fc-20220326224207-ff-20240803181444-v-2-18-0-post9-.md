description: Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) facilitates the formation of membraneless
  organelles within cells, with implications in various biological processes and disease
  states. AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A (ARID1A) is a chromatin
  remodeling factor frequently associated with cancer mutations, yet its functional
  mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we find that ARID1A harbors a prion-like
  domain (PrLD), which facilitates the formation of liquid condensates ...
