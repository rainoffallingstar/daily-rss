description: In our previous work [Yang X.J. Chem. Eng. Data2021, 66, 1385-1398],
  a residual entropy scaling (RES) approach was developed to link viscosity to residual
  entropy using a 4-term power function for 39 refrigerants. In further research [Yang
  X.Int. J. Thermophys.2022, 43, 183], this RES approach was extended to 124 pure
  fluids containing fluids from light gases (hydrogen and helium) to dense fluids
  (e.g., heavy hydrocarbons) and fluids with strong association force (e.g., water).
  In these ...
