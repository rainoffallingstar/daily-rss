description: 'CONCLUSION: Our work extends an existing empirical decision model of
  family decisions about genome sequencing to genetic testing in pediatrics in general,
  adding the categories "individual circumstances" and "emotional states". The factors
  can be further integrated into the Health Belief Model; the importance of emotional
  states is reflected in dual-process theories, such as Fuzzy Trace Theory. Research
  is required on emotional states, differences between DT and PT, parents'' decisions
