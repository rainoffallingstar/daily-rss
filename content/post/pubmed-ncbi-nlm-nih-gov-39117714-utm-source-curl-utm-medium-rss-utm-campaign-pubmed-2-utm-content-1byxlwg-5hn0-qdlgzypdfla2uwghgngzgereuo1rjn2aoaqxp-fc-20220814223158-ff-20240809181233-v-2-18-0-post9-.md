description: Accurate diagnosis of white blood cells from cytopathological images
  is a crucial step in evaluating leukaemia. In recent years, image classification
  methods based on fully convolutional networks have drawn extensive attention and
  achieved competitive performance in medical image classification. In this paper,
  we propose a white blood cell classification network called ResNeXt-CC for cytopathological
  images. First, we transform cytopathological images from the RGB color space to
