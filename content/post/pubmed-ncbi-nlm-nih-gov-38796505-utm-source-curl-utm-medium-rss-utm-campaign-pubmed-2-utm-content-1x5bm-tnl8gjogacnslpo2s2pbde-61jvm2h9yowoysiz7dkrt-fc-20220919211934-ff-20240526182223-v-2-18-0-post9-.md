description: Efficiently mapping of cell types in situ remains a major challenge in
  spatial transcriptomics. Most spot deconvolution tools ignore spatial coordinate
  information and perform extremely slow on large datasets. Here, we introduce SpatialPrompt,
  a spatially aware and scalable tool for spot deconvolution and domain identification.
  SpatialPrompt integrates gene expression, spatial location, and single-cell RNA
  sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset as reference to accurately infer cell-type proportions
