description: Selenocysteine (Sec) metabolism is crucial for cellular function and
  ferroptosis prevention and begins with the uptake of the Sec carrier, selenoprotein
  P (SELENOP). Following uptake, Sec released from SELENOP is metabolized via selenocysteine
  lyase (SCLY), producing selenide, a substrate for selenophosphate synthetase 2 (SEPHS2),
  which provides the essential selenium donor, selenophosphate (H(2)SePO(3)^(-)),
  for the biosynthesis of the Sec-tRNA. Here, we discovered an alternative pathway
