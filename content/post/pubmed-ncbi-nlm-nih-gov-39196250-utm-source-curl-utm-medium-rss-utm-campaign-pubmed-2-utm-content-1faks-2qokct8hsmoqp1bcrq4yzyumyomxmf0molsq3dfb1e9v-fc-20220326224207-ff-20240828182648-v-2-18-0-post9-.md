description: Right ventricular (RV) function is critical to prognosis in all forms
  of pulmonary hypertension. Here we perform molecular phenotyping of RV remodeling
  by transcriptome analysis of RV tissue obtained from 40 individuals, and two animal
  models of RV dysfunction of both sexes. Our unsupervised clustering analysis identified
  'early' and 'late' subgroups within compensated and decompensated states, characterized
  by the expression of distinct signaling pathways, while fatty acid metabolism ...
