description: The economic value of new skin-based tests and blood-based interferon-γ
  release assays (IGRAs) for tuberculosis (TB) infection is not yet well-established.
  This study evaluates the cost and cost-effectiveness in two high-burden countries
  by comparing:(a) new skin-based tests(Diaskintest and Cy-Tb) with the purified protein
  derivative (PPD)-tuberculin test (TST);(b) IGRAs (Standard E TB-Feron ELISA (TBF))with
  approved IGRAs (QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-GP)and TSPOT.TB); and (c) the ...
