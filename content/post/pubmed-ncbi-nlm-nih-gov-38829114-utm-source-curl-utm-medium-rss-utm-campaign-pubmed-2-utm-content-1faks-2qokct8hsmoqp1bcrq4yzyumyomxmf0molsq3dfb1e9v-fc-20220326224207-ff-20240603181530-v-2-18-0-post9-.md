description: The incidence rate of human papillomavirus-driven oropharyngeal cancer
  (HPV-OPC) is increasing in countries with high human development index. HPV cell-free
  DNA (cfDNA) isolated from 3 to 4 mL blood plasma has been successfully used for
  therapy surveillance. A highly discussed application of HPV-cfDNA is early detection
  of HPV-OPC. This requires sensitive and specific cfDNA detection as cfDNA levels
  can be very low. To study the predictive power of pre-diagnostic HPV-cfDNA, archived
  samples ...
