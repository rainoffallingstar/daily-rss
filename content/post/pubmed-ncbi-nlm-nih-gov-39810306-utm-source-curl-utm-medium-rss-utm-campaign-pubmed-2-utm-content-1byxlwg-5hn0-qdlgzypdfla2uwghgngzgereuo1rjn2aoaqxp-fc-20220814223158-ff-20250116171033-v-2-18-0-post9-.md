description: 'CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this framework is the first
  to incorporate WBC scattergrams with CBC data for ALL screening, proving to be an
  efficient method with enhanced sensitivity and specificity. Integrating this framework
  into the screening procedure shows promise for improving the early diagnosis of
  ALL and reducing the burden on medical technicians. The code and dataset are available
