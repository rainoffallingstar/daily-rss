  <p>I’ve been working on an ebook (that you can read over
  <a href="https://raps-with-r.dev/">here</a>) made using Quarto. Since I’m also selling a
  DRM-free Epub and PDF on <a href="https://leanpub.com/raps-with-r/">Leanpub</a> I wanted to
  share some tips and tricks I’ve learned to generate an Epub that passes
  <code>epubcheck</code> using Quarto.</p>
