  Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) specific interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA)
  are the currently used tests for identifying individuals with TB infection for preventive
  treatment. However, challenges around access and implementation have limited their
  use. Novel M.tb specific skin tests (TBST) such as Diaskintest, ESAT6-CFP10 (C-TST),
