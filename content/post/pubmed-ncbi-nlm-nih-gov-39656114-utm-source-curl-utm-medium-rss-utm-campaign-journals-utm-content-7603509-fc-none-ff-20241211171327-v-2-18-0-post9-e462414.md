description: The pathophysiology of sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by
  hemolytic anemia and vaso-occlusion, although its impact on the adaptive immune
  responses remains incompletely understood. To comprehensibly profile the humoral
  immune responses, we immunized SCD mice with T cell-independent (TI) and T cell-dependent
  (TD) antigens. Our study showed that SCD mice have significantly enhanced type 2
  TI (TI-2) immune responses in a manner dependent on the level of type I IFN (IFN-I),
