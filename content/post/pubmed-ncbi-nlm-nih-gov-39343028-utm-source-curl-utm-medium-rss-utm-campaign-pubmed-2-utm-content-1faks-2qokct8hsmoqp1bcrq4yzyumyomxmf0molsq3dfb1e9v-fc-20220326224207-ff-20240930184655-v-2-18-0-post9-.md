description: Plant chemical diversity is largely owing to a number of enzymes which
  catalyse reactions involved in the assembly, and in the subsequent chemical modifications,
  of the core structures of major classes of plant specialized metabolites. One such
  reaction is acylation. With this in mind, to study the deep evolutionary history
  of BAHD and the serine-carboxypeptidase-like (SCPL) acyltransferase genes, we assembled
  phylogenomic synteny networks based on a large-scale inference analysis of ...
