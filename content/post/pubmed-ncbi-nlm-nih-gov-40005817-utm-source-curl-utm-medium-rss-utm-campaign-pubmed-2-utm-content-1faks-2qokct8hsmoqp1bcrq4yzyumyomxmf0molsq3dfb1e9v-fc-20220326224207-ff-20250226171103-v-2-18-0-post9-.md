description: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with intratumoral
  microbiota changes. However, defining the normal pancreatic microbial composition
  remains a challenge. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that the microbial profiling
  of normal pancreatic tissue from healthy organ donors (HC) could help in determining
  the signature of microbiota in PDAC. Matched pairs of tumor and normal tissues from
  PDAC patients (n = 32) and normal pancreatic tissues from HC (n = 17) were analyzed
