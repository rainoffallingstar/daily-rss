description: Nuclear receptors (NRs) are widely expressed transcription factors that
  bind small, lipophilic compounds and regulate diverse biological processes. In the
  small intestine, NRs are known to act as sensors that control transcriptional responses
  to endogenous and exogenous signals, yet their downstream effects have not been
  characterized extensively. Here, we investigate the activation of six different
  NRs individually in human intestinal organoids using small molecules agonists. We
  observe ...
