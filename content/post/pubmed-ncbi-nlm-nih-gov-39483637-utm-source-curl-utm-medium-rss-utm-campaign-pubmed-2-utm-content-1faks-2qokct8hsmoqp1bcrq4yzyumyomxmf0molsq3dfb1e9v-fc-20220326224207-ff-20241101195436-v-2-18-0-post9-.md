description: Over the last decades, various tissue-clearing techniques have broken
  the ground for the optical imaging of whole organs and whole-organisms, providing
  complete representative data sets of three-dimensional biological structures. Along
  with advancements in this field, the development of fluorescent markers for staining
  vessels and capillaries has offered insights into the complexity of vascular networks
  and their impact on disease progression. Here we describe the use of a modified
