description: The dose dependence of the effect of enzyme inducers and the effect of
  the combined administration of two inducers that exert their effect via the same
  induction pathway (pregnane X receptor) have not been well studied. Using oral midazolam
  microdoses (30 μg), we have investigated CYP3A4 induction by St. John's wort (SJW)
  in 11 healthy volunteers using low (300 mg/day containing 7.48 mg hyperforin), therapeutic
  (900 mg/day), and supratherapeutic doses of SJW (1800 mg/day) for 14 days. SJW ...
