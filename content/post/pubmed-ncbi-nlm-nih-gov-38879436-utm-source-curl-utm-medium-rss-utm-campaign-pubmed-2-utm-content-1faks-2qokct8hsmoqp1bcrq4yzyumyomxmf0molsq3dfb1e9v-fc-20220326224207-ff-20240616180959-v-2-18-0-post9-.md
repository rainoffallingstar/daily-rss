description: Mammalian innate-like T cells (ILTCs), including mucosal-associated invariant
  T (MAIT), natural killer T (NKT), and γδ T cells, are abundant tissue-resident lymphocytes
  that have recently emerged as orchestrators of hepatic inflammation, tissue repair,
  and immune homeostasis. This review explores the involvement of different ILTC subsets
  in liver diseases. We explore the mechanisms underlying the pro- and anti-inflammatory
  effector functions of ILTCs in a context-dependent manner. We ...
