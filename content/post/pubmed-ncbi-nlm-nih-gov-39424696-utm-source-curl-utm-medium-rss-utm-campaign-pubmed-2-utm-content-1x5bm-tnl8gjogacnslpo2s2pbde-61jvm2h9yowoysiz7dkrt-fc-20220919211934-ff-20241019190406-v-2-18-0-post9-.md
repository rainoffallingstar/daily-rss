description: Spatial transcriptomics is an emerging technology that enables the profiling
  of gene expression in tissues while preserving spatial location information. This
  innovative approach is anticipated to provide a comprehensive understanding of the
  spatial distribution of different cells within tissues and facilitate in-depth analysis
  of tissue structure. To accurately recognize spatial domains from spatial transcriptomics,
  we have introduced a generalized deep learning method called GAAEST ...
