description: The functional architecture of the long-lived neuronal microtubule (MT)
  cytoskeleton is maintained by various MT-associated proteins (MAPs), most of which
  are known to bind to the MT outer surface. However, electron microscopy (EM) has
  long ago revealed the presence of particles inside the lumens of neuronal MTs, of
  yet unknown identity and function. Here, we use cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET)
  to analyze the three-dimensional (3D) organization and structures of MT lumenal
  particles ...
