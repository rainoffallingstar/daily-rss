description: The latest update of the DHARMa R package (0.4.6) includes an option
  to perform simulated likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) for GLMMs based on a parametric
  bootstrap. I wanted to shortly comment on how this works and why this is useful.
  Why is this useful? A well-known issue with mixed models is that the df ...
