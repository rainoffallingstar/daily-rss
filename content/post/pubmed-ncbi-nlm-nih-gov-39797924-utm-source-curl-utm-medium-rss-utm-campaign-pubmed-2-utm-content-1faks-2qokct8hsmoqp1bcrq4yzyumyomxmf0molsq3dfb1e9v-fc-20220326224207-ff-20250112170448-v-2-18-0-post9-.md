description: Iliosacral screw osteosynthesis is a widely recognized technique for
  stabilizing unstable posterior pelvic ring injuries, offering notable advantages,
  including enhanced mechanical stability, minimal invasiveness, reduced blood loss,
  and lower infection rates. However, the procedure presents technical challenges
  due to the complex anatomy of the sacrum and the proximity of critical neurovascular
  structures. While conventional fluoroscopy remains the primary method for intraoperative
