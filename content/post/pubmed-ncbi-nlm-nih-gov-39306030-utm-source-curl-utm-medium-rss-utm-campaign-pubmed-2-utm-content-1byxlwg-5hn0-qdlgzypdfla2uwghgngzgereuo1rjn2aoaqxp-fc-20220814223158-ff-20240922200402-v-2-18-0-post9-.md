description: The diagnosis of early-stage mycosis fungoides (MF) is challenging due
  to shared clinical and histopathological features with benign inflammatory dermatoses
  (BIDs). Recent evidence has shown that deep learning (DL) can assist pathologists
  in cancer classification, but this field is largely unexplored for cutaneous lymphomas.
  This study evaluates DL in distinguishing early-stage MF from BIDs using a unique
  dataset of 924 hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole-slide images from skin ...
