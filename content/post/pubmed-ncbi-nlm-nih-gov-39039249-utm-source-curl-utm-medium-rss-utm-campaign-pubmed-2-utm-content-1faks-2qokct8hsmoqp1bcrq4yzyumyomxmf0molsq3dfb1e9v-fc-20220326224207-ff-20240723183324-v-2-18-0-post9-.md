description: For many diseases there are delays in diagnosis due to a lack of objective
  biomarkers for disease onset. Here, in 41,931 individuals from the United Kingdom
  Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project, we integrated measurements of ~3,000 plasma proteins
  with clinical information to derive sparse prediction models for the 10-year incidence
  of 218 common and rare diseases (81-6,038 cases). We then compared prediction models
  developed using proteomic data with models developed using either basic ...
