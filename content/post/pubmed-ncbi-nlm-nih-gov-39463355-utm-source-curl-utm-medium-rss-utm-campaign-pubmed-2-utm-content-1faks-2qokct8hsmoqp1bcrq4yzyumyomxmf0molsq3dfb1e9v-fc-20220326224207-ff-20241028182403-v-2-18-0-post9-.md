description: To rapidly adapt to harmful changes to their environment, cells activate
  the integrated stress response (ISR). This results in an adaptive transcriptional
  and translational rewiring, and the formation of biomolecular condensates named
  stress granules (SGs), to resolve stress. In addition to this first line of defence,
  the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) activates a specific transcriptional
  programme to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis. We present evidence that SGs and
