description: Real-world evidence comparing clinical outcomes between venetoclax and
  Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKis) in patients with frontline (1 L) chronic
  lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is lacking. We compared treatment effectiveness of 1
  L venetoclax plus obinutuzumab (VenO) versus BTKi-based regimens. This retrospective
  observational study using Optum Clinformatics Data Mart® included adult patients
