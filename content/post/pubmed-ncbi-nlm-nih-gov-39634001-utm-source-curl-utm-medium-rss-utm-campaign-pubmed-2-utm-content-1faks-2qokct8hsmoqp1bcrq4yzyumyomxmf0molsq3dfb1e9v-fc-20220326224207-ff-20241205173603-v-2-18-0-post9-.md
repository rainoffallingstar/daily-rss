description: Nanoporous metals are a class of nanostructured materials finding extensive
  applications in multiple fields thanks to their unique properties attributed to
  their high surface area and interconnected nanoscale ligaments. They can be prepared
  following different strategies, but the deposition of an arbitrary pure porous metal
  is still challenging. Recently, a dry synthesis of nanoporous films based on the
  plasma treatment of metal thin layers deposited by physical vapour deposition has
