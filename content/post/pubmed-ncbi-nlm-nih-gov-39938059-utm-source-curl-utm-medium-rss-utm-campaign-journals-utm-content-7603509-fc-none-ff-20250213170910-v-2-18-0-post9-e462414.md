description: Novel CD3xCD20 bispecific (BsAb) immunotherapies have entered the armamentarium
  for follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma based on accelerated approvals.
  The primary challenge in utilizing BsAbs lies in patient selection due to variable
  responses, unique toxicity, and health economics. To date, no validated biomarkers
  of therapy response exist, however data demonstrating potential clinical, imaging
  and biological markers relating to BsAb are growing. This review examines ...
