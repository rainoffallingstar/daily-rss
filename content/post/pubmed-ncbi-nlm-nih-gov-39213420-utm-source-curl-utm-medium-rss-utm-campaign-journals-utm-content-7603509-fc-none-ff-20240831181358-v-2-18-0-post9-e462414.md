description: Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) encompass a heterogeneous group of
  post-thymic T-cell lymphomas with more than 30 distinct subtypes associated with
  varied clinicopathological features. Unfortunately, the overall survival of the
  major PTCL subtypes is dismal and has not improved for decades, thus there is an
  urgent unmet clinical need to improve diagnosis, therapies, and clinical outcomes.
  The diagnosis is often challenging requiring a combinatorial evaluation of clinical,
