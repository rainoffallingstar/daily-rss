description: Biomaterial scaffold engineering presents great potential in promoting
  axonal regrowth after spinal cord injury (SCI), yet persistent challenges remain,
  including the surrounding host foreign body reaction and improper host-implant integration.
  Recent advances in mechanobiology spark interest in optimizing the mechanical properties
  of biomaterial scaffolds to alleviate the foreign body reaction and facilitate seamless
  integration. The impact of scaffold stiffness on injured spinal cords has ...
