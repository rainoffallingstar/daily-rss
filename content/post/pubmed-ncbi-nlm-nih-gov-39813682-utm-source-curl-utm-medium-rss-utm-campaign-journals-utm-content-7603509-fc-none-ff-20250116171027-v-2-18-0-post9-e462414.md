description: A mixed phenotype is characteristic of de novo Mixed Phenotype Acute
  Leukemia (MPAL) but can also be seen in other leukemias. It poses substantial classification
  and management dilemmas. Herein, we report a large cohort of acute leukemia with
  a mixed phenotype and define Acute Myeloid Leukemia with Mixed Phenotype (AML-MP)
  and MPAL as two distinct groups by characterizing the clinical, genetic, and transcriptomic
  features. Clinically, patients with AML-MP and MPAL were both treated with ...
