description: The aim of the present study was to test the sequential and simultaneous
  release of rhBMP2 and rhVEGF165 from poly-l-lysine-heparin (PLL-Hep) poly-electrolyte
  multilayer (PEM) coating on titanium surfaces for their ability to enhance peri-implant
  bone formation and CD31 expression around disc-shaped titanium implants (5 × 7 mm)
  in mini-pig mandibles. Bare titanium surfaces loaded with respective growth factor
  combinations served as controls. Ten different surface conditions were ...
