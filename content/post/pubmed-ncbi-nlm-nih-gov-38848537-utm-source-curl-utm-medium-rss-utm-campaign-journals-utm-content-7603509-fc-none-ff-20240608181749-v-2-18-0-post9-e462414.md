description: We previously reported a better outcome in adult and pediatric T-cell
  acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) harboring NOTCH1 and/or FBXW7 mutations without
  alterations of K-N-RAS and PTEN genes. Availability of high-throughput next-generation
  sequencing strategies (NGS) led us to refine the outcome prediction in T-ALL. Targeted
  whole-exome sequencing of 72 T-ALL related oncogenes was performed in 198 adult
  T-ALLs in first remission (CR1) from the GRAALL-2003/2005 protocols (ClinicalTrial.gov,...
