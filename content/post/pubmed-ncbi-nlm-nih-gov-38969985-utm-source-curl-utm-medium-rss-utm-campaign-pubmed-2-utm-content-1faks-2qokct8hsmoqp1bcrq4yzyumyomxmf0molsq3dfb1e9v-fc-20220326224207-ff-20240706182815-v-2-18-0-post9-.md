description: Understanding the interplay of the proteome and the metabolome helps
  to understand cellular regulation and response. To enable robust inferences from
  such multi-omics analyses, we introduced and evaluated a workflow for combined proteome
  and metabolome analysis starting from a single sample. Specifically, we integrated
  established and individually optimized protocols for metabolomic and proteomic profiling
  (EtOH/MTBE and autoSP3, respectively) into a unified workflow (termed MTBE-SP3),
  and ...
