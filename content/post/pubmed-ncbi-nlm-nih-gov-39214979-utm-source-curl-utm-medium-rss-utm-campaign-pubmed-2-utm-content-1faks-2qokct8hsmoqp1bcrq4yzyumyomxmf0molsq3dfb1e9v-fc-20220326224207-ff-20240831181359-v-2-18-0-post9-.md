description: Histone modifications are associated with distinct transcriptional states,
  but it is unclear whether they instruct gene expression. To investigate this, we
  mutate histone H3.3 K9 and K27 residues in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Here,
  we find that H3.3K9 is essential for controlling specific distal intergenic regions
  and for proper H3K27me3 deposition at promoters. The H3.3K9A mutation resulted in
  decreased H3K9me3 at regions encompassing endogenous retroviruses and induced a
