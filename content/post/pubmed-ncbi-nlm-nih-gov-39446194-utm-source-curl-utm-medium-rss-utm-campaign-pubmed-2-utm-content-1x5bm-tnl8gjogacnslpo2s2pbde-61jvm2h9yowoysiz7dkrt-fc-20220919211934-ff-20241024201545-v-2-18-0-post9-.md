description: The integration of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from multiple
  experimental batches enables more comprehensive characterizations of cell states.
  Given that existing methods disregard the structural information between cells and
  genes, we proposed a structure-preserved scRNA-seq data integration approach using
  heterogeneous graph neural network (scHetG). By establishing a heterogeneous graph
  that represents the interactions between multiple batches of cells and genes, and
