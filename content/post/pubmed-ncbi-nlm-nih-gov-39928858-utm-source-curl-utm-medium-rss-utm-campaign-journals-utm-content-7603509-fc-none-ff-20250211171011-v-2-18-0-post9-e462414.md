description: Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is strongly associated with cardiovascular
  diseases (CVDs), and HHcy has been identified as a risk factor for thrombotic diseases.
  Most patients with HHcy die from various complications closely related to thrombotic
  diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. G-protein
  coupled receptors (GPCRs), the central regulators of the cardiovascular system,
  primarily control platelet activation. By examining the effects of HHcy on a panel
