description: Comprehensive genome-wide studies are needed to assess the consequences
  of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-mediated gene editing. We evaluated CRISPR-Cas-mediated
  on-target and off-target effects and examined the integration of the AAV vectors
  employed to deliver the CRISPR-Cas components to neonatal mice livers. The guide
  RNA (gRNA) was specifically designed to target the factor IX gene (F9). On-target
  and off-target insertions/deletions were examined by whole-genome sequencing ...
