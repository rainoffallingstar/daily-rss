description: A lack of advanced preclinical mouse tumor models impedes the progress
  in urothelial carcinoma research. We present here a novel fast, robust, reliable,
  and highly reproducible model for the genetic induction of bladder cancer in immunocompetent
  mice. Different sets of oncogenic transposons (Cmyc, Kras) and Cre drivers were
  transfected into the murine bladder wall of two different genetic backgrounds (Trp53^(fl/fl)
  and Braf^(V600E), Pten^(fl/fl), Ctnnb1^(exon3-fl/fl)). Transfection was ...
