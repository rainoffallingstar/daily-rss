description: SCARB2/LIMP-2 is an abundant lysosomal membrane protein. Previous studies
  have shown LIMP-2 functions as a virus receptor, a chaperone for lysosomal enzyme
  targeting, and a lipid transporter. The large luminal domain of LIMP-2 contains
  a hydrophobic tunnel that enables transport of phospholipids, sphingosine and cholesterol
  from the lysosomal lumen to the membrane. The question about the fate of the lipids
  after LIMP-2-mediated transport is largely unexplored. To elucidate whether LIMP-2
  is ...
