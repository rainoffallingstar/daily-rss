description: Life-threatening acute aortic dissection (AD) demands timely diagnosis
  for effective intervention. To streamline intrahospital workflows, automated detection
  of AD in abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans seems useful to assist humans.
  We aimed at creating a robust convolutional neural network (CNN)-based pipeline
  capable of real-time screening for signs of abdominal AD in CT. In this retrospective
