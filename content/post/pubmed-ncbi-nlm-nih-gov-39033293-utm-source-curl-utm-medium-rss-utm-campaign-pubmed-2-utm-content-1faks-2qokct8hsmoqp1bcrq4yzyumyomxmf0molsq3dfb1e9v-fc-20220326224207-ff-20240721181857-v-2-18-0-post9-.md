description: Most studied, investigating transcriptional changes in myocardial biopsies
  focus on human genes. However, the presence and potential consequence of persistent
  expression of viral genes within the myocardium is unclear. The aim of the study
  was to analyze viral gene expression in RNAseq data from endomyocardial biopsies.
  The NCBI Bioproject library was screened for published projects that included bulk
  RNA sequencing data from endomyocardial biopsies from both healthy and diseased
  patients with ...
