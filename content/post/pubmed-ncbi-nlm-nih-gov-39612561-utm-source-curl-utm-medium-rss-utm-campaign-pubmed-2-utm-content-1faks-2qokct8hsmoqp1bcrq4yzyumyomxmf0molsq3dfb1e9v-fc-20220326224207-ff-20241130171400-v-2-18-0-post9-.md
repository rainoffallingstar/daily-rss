description: CD24 is a mucin-like glycoprotein expressed on trophoblast cells and
  endothelial tissue of first and third trimester placentas. As an immune suppressor,
  CD24 may contribute to maternal immune tolerance to the growing fetus. CD24 is known
  to interact with the sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectins (Siglecs),
  specifically siglec-10. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression
  of both, CD24 and siglec-10 on placental tissue slides from acute covid patients,
  patients ...
