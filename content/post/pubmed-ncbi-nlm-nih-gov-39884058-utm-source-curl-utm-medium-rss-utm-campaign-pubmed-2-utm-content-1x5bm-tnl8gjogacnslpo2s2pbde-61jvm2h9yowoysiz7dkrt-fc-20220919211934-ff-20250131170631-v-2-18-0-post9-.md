description: Precision medicine aims to provide personalized therapies by analyzing
  patient molecular profiles, often focusing on gene expression data. However, effectively
  linking these data to actionable drug discovery for clinical application remains
  challenging. In this paper, we introduce ExPDrug, a neural network (NN) model that
  integrates biological pathways from transcriptomic data with a biomedical knowledge
  graph to facilitate pathway-based drug repurposing. ExPDrug enhances disease ...
