description: Promoters are DNA sequences that bind with RNA polymerase to initiate
  transcription, regulating this process through interactions with transcription factors.
  Accurate identification of promoters is crucial for understanding gene expression
  regulation mechanisms and developing therapeutic approaches for various diseases.
  However, experimental techniques for promoter identification are often expensive,
  time-consuming, and inefficient, necessitating the development of accurate and ...
