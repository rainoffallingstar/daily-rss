description: GBM WHO CNS Grade 4 represents a major challenge for oncology due to
  its aggressive behavior. Conventional imaging has restrictions in detecting tumor
  recurrence. This prospective study aims to identify gene-based biomarkers in whole
  blood instead of isolating exosomes for the early detection of tumor recurrence.
  Blood samples (n = 33) were collected from seven GBM patients at time points before
  and after surgery as well as upon tumor recurrence. Four tumor tissue samples were
  assessed ...
