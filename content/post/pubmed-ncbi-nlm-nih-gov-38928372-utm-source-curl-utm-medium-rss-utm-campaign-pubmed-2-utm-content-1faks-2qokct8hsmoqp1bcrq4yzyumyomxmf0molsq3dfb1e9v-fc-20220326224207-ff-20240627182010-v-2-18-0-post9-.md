description: S/S carriers of 5-HTTLPR have been found to be more risk seeking for
  losses compared to L/L carriers. This finding may be the result of reduced top-down
  control from the frontal cortex due to altered signal pathways involving the amygdala
  and ventral striatum. The serotonergic system is known to be involved in neurodevelopment
  and neuroplasticity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether
  structural differences in white matter can explain the differences in ...
