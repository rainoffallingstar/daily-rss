  treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL),
  but the contribution of the conditioning regimen is still unclear. Here we present
  a retrospective single-center study using conditioning with intermediate-dose total
  body irradiation (TBI) and fludarabine for alloHCT in PTCL. Forty-seven patients
  underwent alloHCT for PTCL between 2010 and 2023 after conditioning with fludarabine
