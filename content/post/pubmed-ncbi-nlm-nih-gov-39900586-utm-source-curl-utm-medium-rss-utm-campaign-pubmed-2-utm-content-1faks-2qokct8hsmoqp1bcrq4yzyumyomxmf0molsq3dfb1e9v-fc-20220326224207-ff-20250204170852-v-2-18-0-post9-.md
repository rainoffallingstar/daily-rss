description: Aromatic belts, ultrashort carbon nanotubes, and related structures,
  are emerging molecular entities in the fields of organic electronics and supramolecular
  chemistry owing to their structural rigidity, fully fused π-conjugation, and well-defined
  cavity. Synthesis of aromatic belts with embedded thiophene structures, which manifest
  significant optoelectronic and conductive properties, has not yet been achieved.
  Herein, we report the synthesis of thiophene-fused aromatic belts (thiophene ...
