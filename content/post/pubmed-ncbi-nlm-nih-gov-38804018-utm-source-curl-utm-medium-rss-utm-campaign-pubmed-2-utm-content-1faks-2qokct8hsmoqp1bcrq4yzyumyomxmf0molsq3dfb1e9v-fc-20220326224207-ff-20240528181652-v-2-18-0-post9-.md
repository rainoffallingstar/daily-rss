description: The nucleus of eukaryotic cells typically makes up around 30% of the
  cell volume and has significantly different mechanics, which can make it effectively
  up to ten times stiffer than the surrounding cytoplasm. Therefore it is an important
  element for cell mechanics, but a quantitative understanding of its mechanical role
  during whole cell dynamics is largely missing. Here we demonstrate that elastic
  phase fields can be used to describe dynamical cell processes in adhesive or ...
