description: Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) is an important cationic
  protein involved in innate airway immunity and highly expressed in mucosal secretions,
  shown to target and inhibit neutrophil elastase (NE), cathepsin G and trypsin activity
  to limit proteolytic activity. In addition to the potent anti-protease activity,
  SLPI has been demonstrated to exert a direct anti-inflammatory effect, which is
  mediated via increased inhibition and competitive binding of NF-κB, regulating ...
