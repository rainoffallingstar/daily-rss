description: Glioma, the most common primary malignant tumor in the central nervous
  system (CNS), lacks effective treatments, and >60% of cases are glioblastoma (GBM),
  the most aggressive form. Despite advances in immunotherapy, GBM remains highly
  resistant. Approaches that target tumor antigens expedite the development of immunotherapies,
  including personalized tumor-specific vaccines, patient-specific target selection,
  dendritic cell (DC) vaccines, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and T cell ...
