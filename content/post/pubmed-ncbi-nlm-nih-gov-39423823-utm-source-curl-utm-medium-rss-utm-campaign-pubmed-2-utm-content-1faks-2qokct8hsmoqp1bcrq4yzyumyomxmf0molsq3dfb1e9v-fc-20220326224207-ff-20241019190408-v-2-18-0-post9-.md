description: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) emerges from chronic inflammation, to
  which activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) contributes by shaping a pro-tumorigenic
  microenvironment. Key to this process is p62, whose inactivation leads to enhanced
  hepatocarcinogenesis. Here, we show that p62 activates the interferon (IFN) cascade
  by promoting STING ubiquitination by tripartite motif protein 32 (TRIM32) in HSCs.
  p62, binding neighbor of BRCA1 gene 1 (NBR1) and STING, triggers the IFN cascade
