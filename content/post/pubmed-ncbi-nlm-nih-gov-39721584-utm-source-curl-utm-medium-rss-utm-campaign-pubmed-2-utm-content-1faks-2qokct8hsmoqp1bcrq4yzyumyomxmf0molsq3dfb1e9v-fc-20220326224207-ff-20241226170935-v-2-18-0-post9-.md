description: Centrosomes organize microtubules that are essential for mitotic divisions
  in animal cells. They consist of centrioles surrounded by pericentriolar material
  (PCM). Questions related to mechanisms of centriole assembly, PCM organization,
  and spindle microtubule formation remain unanswered, partly due to limited availability
  of molecular-resolution structural data inside cells. Here, we use cryo-electron
  tomography to visualize centrosomes across the cell cycle in cells isolated from
