description: Translation initiation is a highly regulated step needed for protein
  synthesis. Most cell-based mechanistic work on translation initiation has been done
  using non-stressed cells growing in medium with sufficient nutrients and oxygen.
  This has yielded our current understanding of 'canonical' translation initiation,
  involving recognition of the mRNA cap by eIF4E1 followed by successive recruitment
  of initiation factors and the ribosome. Many cells, however, such as tumor cells,
