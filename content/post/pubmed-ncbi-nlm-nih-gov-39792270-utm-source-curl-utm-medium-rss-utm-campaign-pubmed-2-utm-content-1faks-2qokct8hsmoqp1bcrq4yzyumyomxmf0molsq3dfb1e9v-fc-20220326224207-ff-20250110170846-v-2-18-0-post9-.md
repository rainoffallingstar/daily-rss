description: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and radiotherapy (SRT) have gained prominence
  as both adjuvant and primary treatment options for patients with skull base tumors
  that are either inoperable or present as residual or recurrent lesions post-surgery.
  The object of the current study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of robotic-assisted
  SRS and SRT across various skull base pathologies. The study was conducted under
  PRISMA guidelines and involved a comprehensive evaluation of databases, ...
