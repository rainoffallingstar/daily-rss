description: Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a severe hepatorenal
  fibrocystic disorder. Its rareness and the variability of disease courses have been
  major obstacles for the establishment of clinical trials on treatment of kidney
  disease in ARPKD. In this observational study we characterized kidney disease progression
  in a very large cohort of up to 658 patients with the clinical diagnosis of ARPKD
  and identified risk factors associated with rapid kidney disease progression. ...
