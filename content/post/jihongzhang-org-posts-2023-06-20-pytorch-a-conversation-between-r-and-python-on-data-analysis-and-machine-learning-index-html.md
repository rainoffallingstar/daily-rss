  <p>When I play with machine learning using python and R, I keep wondering whether I can combine R and Python code in a better way, such as using R for data cleaning/visualization and Python for machine learning. Online resources for PyTorch are basically written using python code. However, I always struggle with pandas and numpy but prefer tidyverse for data cleaning, and data manipulation. That’s why I write this blog. I will start with the Pytorch tensor manipulation and import Pytorch tensor into R, then talk about mixing R/python data analysis with R/python ...
