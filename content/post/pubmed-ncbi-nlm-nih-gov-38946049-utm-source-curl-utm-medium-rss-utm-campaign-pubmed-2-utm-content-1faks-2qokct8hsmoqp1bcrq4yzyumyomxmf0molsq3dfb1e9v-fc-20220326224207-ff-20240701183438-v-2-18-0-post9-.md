description: Stabilin-1 (Stab1) and Stabilin-2 (Stab2) are scavenger receptors expressed
  by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). The Stabilin-mediated scavenging
  function is responsible for regulating the molecular composition of circulating
  blood in mammals. Stab1 and Stab2 have been shown to influence fibrosis in liver
  and kidneys and to modulate inflammation in atherosclerosis. In this context, circulating
  and localized TGFBi and POSTN are differentially controlled by the Stabilins as
