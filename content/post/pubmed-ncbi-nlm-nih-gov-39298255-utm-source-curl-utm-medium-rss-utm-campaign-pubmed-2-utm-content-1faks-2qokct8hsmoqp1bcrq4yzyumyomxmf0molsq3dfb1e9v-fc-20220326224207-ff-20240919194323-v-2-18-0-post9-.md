description: Hydrostatic pressure is a dominant environmental cue for vertically migrating
  marine organisms but the physiological mechanisms of responding to pressure changes
  remain unclear. Here, we uncovered the cellular and circuit bases of a barokinetic
  response in the planktonic larva of the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii. Increased
  pressure induced a rapid, graded, and adapting upward swimming response due to the
  faster beating of cilia in the head multiciliary band. By calcium imaging, we ...
