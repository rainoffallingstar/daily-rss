description: We report the efficient stabilization of nitrogen-centered radical cations
  in a dimeric N-heterotriangulene bridged by a rigid π-conjugated [5]helicene backbone
  (NTH). The rigid scaffold exhibits helical chirality, allowing the enantiomers to
  be separated and their chiroptical properties studied, including circular dichroism
  (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). Successive oxidation towards the
  radical cation NTH•+ and dication NTH2+ reveals strong electronic communication
