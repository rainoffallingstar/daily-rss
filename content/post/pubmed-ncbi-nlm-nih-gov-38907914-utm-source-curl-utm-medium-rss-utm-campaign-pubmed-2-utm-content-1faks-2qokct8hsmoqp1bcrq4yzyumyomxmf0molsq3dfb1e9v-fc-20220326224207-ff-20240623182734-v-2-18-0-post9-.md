description: Observing individual RNA molecules provides valuable insights into their
  regulation, interactions with other cellular components, organization, and functions.
  Although fluorescent light-up aptamers (FLAPs) have recently shown promise for RNA
  imaging, their wider applications have been mostly hindered by poor brightness and
