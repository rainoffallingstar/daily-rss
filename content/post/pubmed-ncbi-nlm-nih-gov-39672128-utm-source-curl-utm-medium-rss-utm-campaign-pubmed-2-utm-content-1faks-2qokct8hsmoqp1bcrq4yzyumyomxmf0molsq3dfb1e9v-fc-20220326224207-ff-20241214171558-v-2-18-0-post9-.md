description: We study a mechanism to induce superconductivity in atomically thin semiconductors
  where excitons mediate an effective attraction between electrons. Our model includes
  interaction effects beyond the paradigm of phonon-mediated superconductivity and
  connects to the well-established limits of Bose and Fermi polarons. By accounting
  for the strong-coupling physics of trions, we find that the effective electron-exciton
  interaction develops a strong frequency and momentum dependence accompanied by ...
