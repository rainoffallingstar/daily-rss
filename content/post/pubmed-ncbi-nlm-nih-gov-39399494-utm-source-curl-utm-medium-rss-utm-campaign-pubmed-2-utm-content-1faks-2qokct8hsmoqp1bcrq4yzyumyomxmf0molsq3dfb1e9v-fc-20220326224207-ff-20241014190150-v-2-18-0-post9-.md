description: High levels of pre-existing antibodies are a major challenge for the
  application of viral vectors since they can severely limit their efficacy. To identify
  promising candidates among adeno-associated virus (AAV) based vectors for future
  gene therapies for the treatment of hereditary neuromuscular disorders (NMDs), we
  investigated the antibody levels in sera from patients with NMDs against 18 AAV
  types, including 11 AAVs with wild-type capsids, 5 AAVs with peptide-modified capsids
  and 2 AAVs ...
