description: Adoptive T cell therapy is a promising therapy for multiple myeloma (MM),
  but its efficacy hinges on understanding relevant biological and predictive markers
  of response. B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a key target antigen in MM, with
  active development of multiple anti-BCMA T cell engagers (TCE) and chimeric antigen
  receptor T cell (CAR T) therapies. The regulation of surface BCMA expression by
  MM cells, resulting in the shedding of soluble BCMA (sBCMA), has triggered debate
