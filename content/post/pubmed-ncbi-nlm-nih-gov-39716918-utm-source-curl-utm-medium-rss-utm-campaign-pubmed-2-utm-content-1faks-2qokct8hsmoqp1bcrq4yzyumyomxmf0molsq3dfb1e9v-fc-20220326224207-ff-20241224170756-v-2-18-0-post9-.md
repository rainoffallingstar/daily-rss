  patients, nevertheless, resistance remains a significant problem. Here, intrinsic
  and extrinsic factors in the tumor microenvironment are discussed, including the

  3 (LAG-3) and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (TIM-3).
  While most studies focus on immune cell expression of these proteins, we investigated
