description: The γ-ray emission from the W51 complex is widely acknowledged to be
  attributed to the interaction between the cosmic rays (CRs) accelerated by the shock
  of supernova remnant (SNR) W51C and the dense molecular clouds in the adjacent star-forming
  region, W51B. However, the maximum acceleration capability of W51C for CRs remains
  elusive. Based on observations conducted with the Large High Altitude Air Shower
  Observatory (LHAASO), we report a significant detection of γ rays emanating from
