description: In vertebrates, the three orthogonal body axes, anteroposterior (AP),
  dorsoventral (DV) and left-right (LR) are determined at gastrula and neurula stages
  by the Spemann-Mangold organizer and its equivalents. A common feature of AP and
  DV axis formation is that an evolutionary conserved interplay between growth factors
  (Wnt, BMP) and their extracellular antagonists (e.g. Dkk1, Chordin) creates signaling
  gradients for axial patterning. Recent work showed that LR patterning in Xenopus
  follows ...
