description: Applying CAR T-cell therapy to treat solid tumors is especially challenging
  due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). While our modular RevCAR
  system enhances the safety and controllability of CAR T-cell therapy, effectively
  targeting solid tumors remains difficult. Since PD-L1 is an immune checkpoint frequently
  upregulated by cancer cells and their microenvironment, it is a relevant target
  for solid tumors. Here, we introduce a novel PD-L1 RevTM capable of redirecting
