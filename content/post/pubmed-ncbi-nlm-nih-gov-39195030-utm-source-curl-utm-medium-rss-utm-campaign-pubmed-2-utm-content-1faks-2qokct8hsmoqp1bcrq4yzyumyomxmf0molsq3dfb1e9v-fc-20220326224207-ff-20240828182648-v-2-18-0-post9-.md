description: Anti-VEGF agents, e.g., bevacizumab, are used in retinal surgery, while
  their interaction with silicone oils and novel hydrogels remains unclear. This study
  examines the in vitro pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab in silicone oil-filled eyes
  compared to various hydrogel replacements and the porcine vitreous body as well
  as its impact on the interface tension of silicone oils. An in vitro model filled
  with light or heavy silicone oil, porcine vitreous bodies, or hydrogels (alginate
  and ...
