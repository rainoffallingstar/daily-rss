description: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is fundamental for understanding molecular
  mechanisms in health and disease. Here, we present a protocol for efficient and
  high-resolution ST in 2D/3D with Open-ST. We describe all steps for repurposing
  Illumina flow cells into spatially barcoded capture areas and preparing ST libraries
  from stained cryosections. We detail the computational workflow for generating 2D/3D
  molecular maps ("virtual tissue blocks"), aligned with histological data, unlocking
