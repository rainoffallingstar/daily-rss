description: Despite increasing knowledge about small extracellular vesicle (sEV)
  composition and functions in cell-cell communication, the mechanism behind their
  biogenesis remains unclear. Here, we reveal for the first time that sEV biogenesis
  and release into the microenvironment are tightly connected with another important
  organelle, Lipid Droplets (LDs). The correlation was observed in several human cancer
  cell lines as well as patient-derived colorectal cancer stem cells (CR-CSCs). Our
