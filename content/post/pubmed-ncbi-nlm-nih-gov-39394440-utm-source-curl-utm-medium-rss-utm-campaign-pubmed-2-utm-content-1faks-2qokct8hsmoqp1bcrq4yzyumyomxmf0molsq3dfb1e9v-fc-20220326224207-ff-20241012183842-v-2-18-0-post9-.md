description: Medical Object Detection (MOD) is a clinically relevant image processing
  method that locates structures of interest in radiological image data at object-level
  using bounding boxes. High-performing MOD models necessitate large datasets accurately
  reflecting the feature distribution of the corresponding problem domain. However,
  strict privacy regulations protecting patient data often hinder data consolidation,
  negatively affecting the performance and generalization of MOD models. ...
