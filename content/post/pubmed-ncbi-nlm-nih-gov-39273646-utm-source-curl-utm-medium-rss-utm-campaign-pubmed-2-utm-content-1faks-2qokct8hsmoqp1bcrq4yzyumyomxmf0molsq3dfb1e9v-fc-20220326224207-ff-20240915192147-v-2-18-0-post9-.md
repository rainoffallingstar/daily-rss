description: Corneal transparency and avascularity are essential for vision. The avascular
  cornea transitions into the vascularized conjunctiva at the limbus. Here, we explore
  a limbal stromal cell sub-population that expresses ABCB5 and has mesenchymal stem
  cell characteristics. Human primary corneal stromal cells were enriched for ABCB5
  by using FACS sorting. ABCB5+ cells expressed the MSC markers CD90, CD73, and CD105.
  ABCB5+ but not ABCB5- cells from the same donor displayed evidence of pluripotency
