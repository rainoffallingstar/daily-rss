description: Persistent sodium current (I(NaP)) is an important activity-dependent
  regulator of neuronal excitability. It is involved in a variety of physiological
  and pathological processes, including pacemaking, prolongation of sensory potentials,
  neuronal injury, chronic pain and diseases such as epilepsy and amyotrophic lateral
  sclerosis. Despite its importance, neither the molecular basis nor the regulation
  of I(NaP) are sufficiently understood. Of particular significance is a solid knowledge
