description: Small open reading frames (smORFs) shorter than 100 codons are widespread
  and perform essential roles in microorganisms, where they encode proteins active
  in several cell functions, including signal pathways, stress response, and antibacterial
  activities. However, the ecology, distribution and role of small proteins in the
  global microbiome remain unknown. Here, we construct a global microbial smORFs catalog
  (GMSC) derived from 63,410 publicly available metagenomes across 75 distinct ...
