description: An in-depth multi-omic molecular characterisation of poly(adenosine 5'-diphosphate
  [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors revealed a distinct poly-pharmacology
  of niraparib (Zejula®) mediated by its interaction with lanosterol synthase (LSS),
  which is not observed with other PARP inhibitors. Niraparib, in a similar way to
  the LSS inhibitor Ro-48-8071, induced activation of the 24,25-epoxysterol shunt
  pathway, which is a regulatory signalling branch of the cholesterol biosynthesis
