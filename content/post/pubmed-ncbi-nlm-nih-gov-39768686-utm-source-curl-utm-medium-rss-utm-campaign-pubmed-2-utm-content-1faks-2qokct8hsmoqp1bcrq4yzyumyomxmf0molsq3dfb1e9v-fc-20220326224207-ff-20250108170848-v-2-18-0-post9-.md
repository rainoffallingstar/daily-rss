description: 'Objectives: Cleaning splints (CSs) can facilitate interdental brush
  (IDB) insertion and guide IDBs during cleaning movement. Cleaning efficacy with
  and without CSs was to be assessed and compared for a fully dentate (FD) and a partially
  edentulous (PE) situation. Methods: For two maxillary typodont models simulating
  either an FD situation or a PE situation with every second tooth missing, suitable
  IDBs were selected and each cleaning splint was designed and fabricated by 3D-printing.
