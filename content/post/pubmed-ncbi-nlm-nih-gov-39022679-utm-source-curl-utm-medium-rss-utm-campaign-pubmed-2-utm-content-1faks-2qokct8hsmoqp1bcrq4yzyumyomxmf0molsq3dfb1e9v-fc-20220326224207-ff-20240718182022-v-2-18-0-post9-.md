description: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a challenging cancer with high mortality
  rates, limited predictability, and a lack of effective prognostic indicators. The
  relationship between small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and HCC is poorly understood.
  Based on the literature data, snoRNA studies were primarily focused on viral-related
  causes of HCC, such as Hepatitis B or C viruses (HBV or HCV). According to these
  studies, we selected four snoRNAs (snoRA12, snoRA47, snoRA80E, and snoRD126) for
  exploration ...
