description: An on-chip asymmetric directional coupler (DC) can convert fundamental
  modes to higher-order modes and is one of the core components of mode-division multiplexing
  (MDM) technology. In this study, we propose that waveguides of the asymmetric DC
  can be trimmed by silicon ion implantation to tune the effective refractive index
  and facilitate mode conversion into higher-order modes. Through this method of tuning,
  transmission changes of up to 18 dB have been realized with one ion implantation
