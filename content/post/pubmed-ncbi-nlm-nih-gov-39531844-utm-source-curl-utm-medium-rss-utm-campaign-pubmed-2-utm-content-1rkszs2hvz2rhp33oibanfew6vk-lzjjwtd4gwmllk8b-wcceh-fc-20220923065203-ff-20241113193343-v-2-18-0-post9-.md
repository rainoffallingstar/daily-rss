description: Liquid biopsy techniques using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) play an increasingly
  important role in the characterization and surveillance of solid tumors. For blood
  cancers, molecular response assessment techniques using circulating malignant cells
  or bone marrow aspirates are well established in clinical care. However, cfDNA has
  an emerging role in hematology as well, with the opportunity for disease assessment
  and quantification independent of circulating disease burden or invasive biopsies.
