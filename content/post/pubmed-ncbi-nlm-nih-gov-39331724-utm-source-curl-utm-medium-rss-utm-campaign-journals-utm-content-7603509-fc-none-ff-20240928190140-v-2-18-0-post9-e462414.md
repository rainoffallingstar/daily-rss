description: No randomized trial has directly compared daratumumab and lenalidomide
  (D-R) maintenance therapy versus standard-of-care lenalidomide (R) alone post-transplant.
  Here, we report the primary results of the phase 3 AURIGA study evaluating D-R versus
  R maintenance in NDMM patients who were in ≥very good partial response, minimal
  residual disease (MRD; threshold 10-5) positive, and anti-CD38 naïve post-transplant.
  Patients were randomized 1:1 to D-R or R maintenance for up to 36 cycles. Two ...
