description: High-plex imaging techniques enable the detection and quantification
  of a multitude of markers in tissue biopsies at single-cell or near-single-cell
  resolution. In lymphoma, this can facilitate the detection and characterization
  of cellular phenotypes and interactions, describing both tumor and microenvironmental
  cells. In combination with other techniques, high-plex imaging allows the investigation
  of biological mechanisms and clinically relevant biomarkers. CO-Detection by IndEXing
