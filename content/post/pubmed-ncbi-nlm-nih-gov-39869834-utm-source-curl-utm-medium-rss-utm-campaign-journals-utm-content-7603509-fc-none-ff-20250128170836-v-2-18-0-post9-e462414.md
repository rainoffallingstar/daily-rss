description: Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a prevalent RNA modification
  essential for cell survival. The process is catalyzed by the Adenosine Deaminase
  Acting on RNA (ADAR) enzyme family that converts adenosines in double-stranded RNAs
  (dsRNAs) into inosines, which are read as guanosines during translation. Deep sequencing
  has helped to reveal that A-to-I editing occurs across various types of RNAs to
  affect their functions. RNA editing detection is now so sophisticated that we can
  achieve ...
