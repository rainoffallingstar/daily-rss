description: RNA-binding proteins are essential for gene regulation and the spatial
  organization of cells. Here, we report that the yeast ribosome biogenesis factor
  Loc1p is an intrinsically disordered RNA-binding protein with eight repeating positively
  charged, unstructured nucleic acid binding (PUN) motifs. While a single of these
  previously undefined motifs stabilizes folded RNAs, multiple copies strongly cooperate
  to catalyze RNA folding. In the presence of RNA, these multivalent PUN motifs drive
