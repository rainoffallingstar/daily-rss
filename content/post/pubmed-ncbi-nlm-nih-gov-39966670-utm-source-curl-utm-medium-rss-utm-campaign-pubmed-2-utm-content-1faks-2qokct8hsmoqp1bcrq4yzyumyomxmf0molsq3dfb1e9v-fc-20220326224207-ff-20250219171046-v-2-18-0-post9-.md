description: Tissue patterning coordinates morphogenesis, cell dynamics and fate specification.
  Understanding how precision in patterning is robustly achieved despite inherent
  developmental variability during mammalian embryogenesis remains a challenge. Here,
  based on cell dynamics quantification and simulation, we show how salt-and-pepper
  epiblast and primitive endoderm (PrE) cells pattern the inner cell mass of mouse
  blastocysts. Coupling cell fate and dynamics, PrE cells form apical polarity-dependent...
