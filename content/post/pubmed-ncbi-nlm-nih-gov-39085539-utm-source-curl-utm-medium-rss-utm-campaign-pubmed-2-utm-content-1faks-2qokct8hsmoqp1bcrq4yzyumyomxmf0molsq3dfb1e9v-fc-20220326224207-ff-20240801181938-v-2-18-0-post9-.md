description: Advancements in optical coherence control^(1-5) have unlocked many cutting-edge
  applications, including long-haul communication, light detection and ranging (LiDAR)
  and optical coherence tomography^(6-8). Prevailing wisdom suggests that using more
  coherent light sources leads to enhanced system performance and device functionalities^(9-11).
  Our study introduces a photonic convolutional processing system that takes advantage
  of partially coherent light to boost computing parallelism ...
