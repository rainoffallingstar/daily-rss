description: Mice infected with a recombinant adeno-associated virus carrying a replication-competent
  hepatitis B virus genome (rAAV-HBV) via the intravenous route establish a persistent
  HBV replication in hepatocytes and develop immune tolerance. They serve as models
  to evaluate antiviral immunity and to assess potential therapeutic approaches for
  chronic HBV infection. Combining selected HBV variants and different mouse genotypes
  allows for addressing a broad spectrum of research questions. This ...
