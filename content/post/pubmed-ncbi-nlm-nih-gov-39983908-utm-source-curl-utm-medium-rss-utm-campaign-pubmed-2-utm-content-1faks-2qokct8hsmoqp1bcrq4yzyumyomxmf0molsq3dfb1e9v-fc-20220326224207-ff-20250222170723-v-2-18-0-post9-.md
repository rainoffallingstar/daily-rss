description: Myocardial infarction occurs when the coronary supply of oxygen and nutrients
  to part of the heart is interrupted. In contrast to adult mammals, adult zebrafish
  have a remarkable ability to regenerate their heart after cardiac injury. Several
  processes are involved in this regenerative response including inflammation, coronary
  endothelial cell proliferation and revascularization, endocardial expansion, cardiomyocyte
  repopulation, and transient scar formation. To identify additional regulators ...
