description: Nearly half of multiple myeloma (MM) patients have hyperdiploidy (HMM)
  at diagnosis. Although HMM occurs early, the mutational processes before and after
  hyperdiploidy are still unclear. Here, we used 72 WGS samples from patients with
  HMM and identified pre and post HMM mutation to define the chronology of development
  of hyperdipoidy. A MM cell accumulated on median 0.56 mutations per mb pre-HMM and
  for every clonal pre-HMM mutation, 1.21 mutations accumulated post-HMM. This analysis
