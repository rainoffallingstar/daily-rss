description: A 48-year-old woman was found hanged in the bathroom. She was wearing
  a Holter monitor, which was later analysed by a cardiologist. During autopsy, findings
  congruent with atypical hanging were collected. The ECG showed a 20 s asystole and
  four minutes later bradycardia, which progressed to a second-degree AV-block Mobitz
  I, then Mobitz II, then to a third-degree AV-block. Finally, only P waves could
  be observed, before heart action ceased. This is one of few cases reporting ECG-changes
