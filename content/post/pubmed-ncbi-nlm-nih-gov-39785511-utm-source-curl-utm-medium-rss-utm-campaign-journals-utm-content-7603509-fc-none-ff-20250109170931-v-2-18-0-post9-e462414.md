description: T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematological
  malignancy with a poor prognosis and limited options for targeted therapies. Identifying
  new molecular targets to develop novel therapeutic strategies is the pressing immediate
  issue in T-ALL. Here, we observed high expression of WD Repeat-Containing Protein
