description: T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is an aggressive lymphoid malignancy
  with limited treatment options. To discover new treatment targets for T-PLL, we
  performed high-throughput drug sensitivity screening on 30 primary patient samples
  ex-vivo. After screening over 2'800 unique compounds, we found T-PLL to be more
  resistant to most drug classes, including chemotherapeutics, compared to other blood
  cancers. Furthermore, we discovered previously not reported vulnerabilities of T-PLL.
