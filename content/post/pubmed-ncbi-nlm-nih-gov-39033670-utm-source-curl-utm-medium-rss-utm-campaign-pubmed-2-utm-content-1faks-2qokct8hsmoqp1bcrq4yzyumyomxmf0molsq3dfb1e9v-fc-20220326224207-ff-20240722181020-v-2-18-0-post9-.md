description: Childhood maltreatment (CM) has been demonstrated to be associated with
  changes in resting-state functional connectivity of the default-mode network (DMN)
  across various mental disorders. Growing evidence regarding severity of CM is available
  but transdiagnostic research considering the role of both severity and duration
  of CM for DMN connectivity at rest is still scarce. We recruited a sample of participants
  with varying levels of CM suffering from three disorders in which a history of CM
