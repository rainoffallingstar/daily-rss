description: The diagnostic landscape of brain tumors integrates comprehensive molecular
  markers alongside traditional histopathological evaluation. DNA methylation and
  next-generation sequencing (NGS) have become a cornerstone in central nervous system
  (CNS) tumor classification. A limiting requirement for NGS and methylation profiling
  is sufficient DNA quality and quantity, which restrict its feasibility. Here we
