description: Zero- to ultralow-field nuclear magnetic resonance (ZULF NMR) allows
  molecular structure elucidation via measurement of electron-mediated spin-spin J-couplings.
  This study examines zero-field J-spectra from molecules with quadrupolar nuclei,
  exemplified by solutions of various isotopologues of ammonium cations. The spectra
  reveal differences between various isotopologues upon extracting precise J-coupling
  values from pulse-acquire measurements. A primary isotope effect, △ J = γ 14 N /
