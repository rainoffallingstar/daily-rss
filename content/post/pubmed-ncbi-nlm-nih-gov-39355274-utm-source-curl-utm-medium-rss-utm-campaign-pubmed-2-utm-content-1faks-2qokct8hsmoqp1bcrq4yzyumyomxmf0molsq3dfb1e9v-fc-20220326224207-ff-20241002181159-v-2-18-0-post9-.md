description: The Atacama Desert's naturally elevated metal(loid)s pose a unique challenge
  for assessing the environmental impact of mining, particularly for indigenous communities
  residing in these areas. This study investigates how copper mining influences the
  dispersion of these elements in the wind-transportable fraction (<75 μm) of surface
  sediments across an 80 km radius. We employed a multi-pronged approach, utilizing
  spatial modeling to map element distributions, exponential decay analysis to ...
