description: Homeostasis models posit that nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) serves,
  in part, to upregulate the endogenous opioid system in order to compensate for an
  opioid deficiency. A few studies have demonstrated lower basal levels of beta-endorphin
  (BE), an endogenous opioid, in individuals with NSSI. However, longitudinal studies
  are missing. Hence, the present study aimed to investigate the longitudinal associations
  between NSSI, comorbid psychopathology (i.e., borderline personality disorder ...
