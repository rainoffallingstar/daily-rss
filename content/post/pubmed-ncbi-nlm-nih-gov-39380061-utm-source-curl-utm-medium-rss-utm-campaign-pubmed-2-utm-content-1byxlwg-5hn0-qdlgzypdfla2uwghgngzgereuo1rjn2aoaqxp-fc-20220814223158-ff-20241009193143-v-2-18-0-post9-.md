description: Precise calling of promiscuous adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing sites
  from transcriptomic datasets is hindered by DNA mutations and sequencing/mapping
  errors. Here, we present a stepwise computational framework, called DEMINING, to
  distinguish RNA editing and DNA mutations directly from RNA sequencing datasets,
  with an embedded deep learning model named DeepDDR. After transfer learning, DEMINING
  can also classify RNA editing sites and DNA mutations from non-primate sequencing
  samples. ...
