description: Courses of SARS-CoV-2 infections are highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic
  to lethal COVID-19. Though research has shown that host genetic factors contribute
  to this variability, cohort-based joint analyses of variants from the entire allelic
  spectrum in individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections are still lacking.
  Here, we present the results of whole genome sequencing in 1,220 mainly vaccine-naïve
  individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 827 hospitalized ...
