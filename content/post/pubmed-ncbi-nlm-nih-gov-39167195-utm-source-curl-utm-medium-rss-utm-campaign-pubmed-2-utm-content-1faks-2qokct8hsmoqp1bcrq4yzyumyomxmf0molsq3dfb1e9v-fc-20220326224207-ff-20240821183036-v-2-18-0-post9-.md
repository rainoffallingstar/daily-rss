description: The term cardiac amyloidosis (CA) refers to the accumulation of extracellular
  amyloid deposits in the heart because of different conditions often affecting multiple
  organs including brain, kidney and liver. Notably, cardiac involvement significantly
  impacts prognosis of amyloidosis, with cardiac biomarkers playing a pivotal role
  in prognostic stratification. Therapeutic management poses a challenge due to limited
  response to conventional heart failure therapies, necessitating targeted ...
