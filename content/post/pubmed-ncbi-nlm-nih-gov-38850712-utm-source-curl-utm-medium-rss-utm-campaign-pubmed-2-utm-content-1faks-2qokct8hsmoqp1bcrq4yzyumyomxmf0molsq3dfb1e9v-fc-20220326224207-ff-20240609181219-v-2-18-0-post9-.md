description: Actin organization is crucial for establishing cell polarity, which influences
  processes such as directed cell motility and division. Despite its critical role
  in living organisms, achieving similar polarity in synthetic cells remains challenging.
  In this study, we employ a bottom-up approach to investigate how molecular crowders
  facilitate the formation of cortex-like actin networks and how these networks localize
  and organize based on membrane shape. Using giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) ...
