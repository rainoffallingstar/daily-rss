description: Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors are increasingly used for preclinical
  and clinical cardiac gene therapy approaches. However, gene transfer to cardiomyocytes
  poses a challenge due to differences between AAV serotypes in terms of expression
  efficiency in vitro and in vivo. For example, AAV9 vectors work well in rodent heart
  muscle cells in vivo but not in cultivated neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes
  (NRVCMs), necessitating the use of AAV6 vectors for in vitro studies. Therefore,
