description: A light-mediated cyclization reaction initiated by an atom transfer radical
  addition (ATRA) of haloalkanes onto alkenes was exploited for the synthesis of functionalized
  dihydrobenzofurans. Initial investigation indicated that the dimeric gold catalyst
  [Au(2)(μ-dppm)(2)Cl(2)] can effectively be used for intermolecular ATRA reactions.
  Further, the reactivity was applied in a cascade-like cyclization for the preparation
  of dihydrobenzofuran derivatives. With the presented photochemical ...
