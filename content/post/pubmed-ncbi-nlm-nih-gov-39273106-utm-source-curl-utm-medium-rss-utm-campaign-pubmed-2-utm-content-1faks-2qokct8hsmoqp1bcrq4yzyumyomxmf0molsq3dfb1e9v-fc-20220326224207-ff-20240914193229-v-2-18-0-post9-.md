description: We reported previously that in preclinical models, BMP4 is a potent inhibitor
  of breast cancer metastasis and that high BMP4 protein levels predict favourable
  patient outcomes. Here, we analysed a breast cancer xenograft with or without enforced
  expression of BMP4 to gain insight into the mechanisms by which BMP4 suppresses
  metastasis. Transcriptomic analysis of cancer cells recovered from primary tumours
  and phosphoproteomic analyses of cancer cells exposed to recombinant BMP4 revealed
