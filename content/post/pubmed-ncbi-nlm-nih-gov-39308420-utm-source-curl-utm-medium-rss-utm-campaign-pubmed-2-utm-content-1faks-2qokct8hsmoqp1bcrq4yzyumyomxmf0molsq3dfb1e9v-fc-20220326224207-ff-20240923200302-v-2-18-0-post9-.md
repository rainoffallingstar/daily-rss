description: Alterations within the tryptophan-kynurenine metabolic pathway have been
  linked to the etiology of colorectal cancer (CRC), but the relevance of this pathway
  for prognostic outcomes in CRC patients needs further elucidation. Therefore, we
  investigated associations between circulating concentrations of tryptophan-kynurenine
  pathway metabolites and all-cause mortality among CRC patients. This study utilizes
