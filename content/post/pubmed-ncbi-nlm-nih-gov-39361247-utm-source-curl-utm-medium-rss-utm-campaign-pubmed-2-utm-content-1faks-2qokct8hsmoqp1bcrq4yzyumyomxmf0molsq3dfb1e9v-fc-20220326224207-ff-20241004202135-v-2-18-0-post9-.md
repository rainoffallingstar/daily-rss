description: The leaf extract of Alnus rugosa (AR) together with the isolated compound
  baicalein 5,6-dimethyl ether (BME) were investigated for their antioxidant, radical
  scavenging, antiaging, and neuroprotective properties using the Caenorhabditis elegans
  model. The stress resistance and antiaging potential of AR and BME were assessed
  in wild-type N2 and transgenic C. elegans strains CF1553, TJ356, and BA17. Transgenic
  CL4176 expressing the human amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) was used as a model for ...
