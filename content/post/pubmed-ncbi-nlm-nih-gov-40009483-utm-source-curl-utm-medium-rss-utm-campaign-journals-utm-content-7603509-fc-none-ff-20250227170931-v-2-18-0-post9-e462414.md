description: T-cell recruiting bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are in clinical development
  for relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Despite promising results,
  early clinical trials have failed to demonstrate durable responses. We investigated
  whether activation of the innate immune system through stimulator of interferon
  genes (STING) can enhance target-cell killing by a BsAb targeting CD33 (CD33 BiTE®
  molecule, AMG 330). Indeed, we show that cytotoxicity against AML mediated by AMG
  330 can ...
