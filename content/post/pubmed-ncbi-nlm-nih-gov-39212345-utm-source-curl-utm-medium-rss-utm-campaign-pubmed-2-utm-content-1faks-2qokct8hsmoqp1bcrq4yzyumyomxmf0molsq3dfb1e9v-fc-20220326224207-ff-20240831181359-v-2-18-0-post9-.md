description: Local recurrence after radiotherapy is common in locally advanced head
  and neck cancer (HNC) patients. Re-irradiation can improve local disease control,
  but disease progression remains frequent. Hence, predictive biomarkers are needed
  to adapt treatment intensity to the patient's individual risk. We quantified circulating
  tumor DNA (ctDNA) in sequential plasma samples and correlated ctDNA levels with
  disease outcome. Ninety four longitudinal plasma samples from 16 locally advanced
