description: Bacterial biofilms are complex cell communities within a self-produced
  extracellular matrix, crucial in various fields but challenging to analyze in 3D.
  We developed a "biofilm-in-capillary" growth method compatible with full-rotation
  soft X-ray tomography, enabling high-resolution 3D imaging of bacterial cells and
  their matrix during biofilm formation. This approach offers 50 nm isotropic spatial
  resolution, rapid imaging, and quantitative native analysis of biofilm structure.
