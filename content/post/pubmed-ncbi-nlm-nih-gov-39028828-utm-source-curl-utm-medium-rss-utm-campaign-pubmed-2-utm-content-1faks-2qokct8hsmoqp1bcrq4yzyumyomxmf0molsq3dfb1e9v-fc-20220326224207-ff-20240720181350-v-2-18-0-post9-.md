description: Regulatory T cells (T(regs)) control adaptive immunity and restrain type
  2 inflammation in allergic disease. Interleukin-33 promotes the expansion of tissue-resident
  T(regs) and group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s); however, how T(regs) locally
  coordinate their function within the inflammatory niche is not understood. Here,
  we show that ILC2s are critical orchestrators of T(reg) function. Using spatial,
  cellular, and molecular profiling of the type 2 inflamed niche, we found that ILC2s
