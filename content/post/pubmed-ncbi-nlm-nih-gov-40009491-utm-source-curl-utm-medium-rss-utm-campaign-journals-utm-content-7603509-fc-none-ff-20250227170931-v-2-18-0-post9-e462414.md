description: The non-O blood group is a well-established risk factor for venous thromboembolism
  (VTE). However, the association between plasma levels of the histo-blood group ABO
  system transferase (BGAT), the gene product of the ABO locus, and VTE risk remains
  unclear. We aimed to investigate the association between plasma BGAT levels and
  risk of future VTE, and whether this relationship was mediated by plasma von Willebrand
  factor (VWF) or coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) as VWF is glycosylated by ...
