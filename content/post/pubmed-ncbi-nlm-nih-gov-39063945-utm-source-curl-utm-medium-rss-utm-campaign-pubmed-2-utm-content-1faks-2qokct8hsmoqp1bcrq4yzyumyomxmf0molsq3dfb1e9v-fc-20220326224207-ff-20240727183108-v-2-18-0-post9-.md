description: '(1) Background: Adequate organ perfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass
  (CPB) requires accurate estimation and adjustment of flow rates which conventional
  methods may not always achieve. Perioperative monitoring of cerebral oxygen saturation
  (ScO(2)) may detect changes in oxygen transport. This study aims to compare estimated
  and measured perfusion flow rates and assess the capacity of ScO(2) to detect subtle
  changes in oxygen transport during CPB. (2) Methods: This observational study ...'
