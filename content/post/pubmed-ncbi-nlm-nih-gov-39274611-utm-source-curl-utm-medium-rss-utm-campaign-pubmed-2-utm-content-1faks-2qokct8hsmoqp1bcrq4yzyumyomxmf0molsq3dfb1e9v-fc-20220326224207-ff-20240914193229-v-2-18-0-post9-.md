description: Transferring the intraoral situation accurately to the dental laboratory
  is crucial for fabricating precise restorations. This study aimed to compare the
  dimensional accuracy of a new hydrophilic quadrofunctional vinyl polysiloxane (VPS)
  and polyether (PE), in combination with different impression techniques (mono-phase
  single step or dual-phase single step). The reference model simulated a partially
  edentulous mandible. Stainless-steel precision balls were welded to specific teeth
  and were ...
