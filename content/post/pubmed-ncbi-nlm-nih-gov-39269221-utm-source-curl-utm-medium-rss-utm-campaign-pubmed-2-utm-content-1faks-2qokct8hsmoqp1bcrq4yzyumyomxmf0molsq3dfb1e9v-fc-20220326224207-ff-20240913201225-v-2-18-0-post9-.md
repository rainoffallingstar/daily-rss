  energy and spin-orbit coupling surfaces for studying the photodissociation of CH(2)OO
  to H(2)CO(X¹A(1)) + O¹D and H(2)CO(X¹A(1)) + O³P channels is presented. For the
  evaluation of surfaces, multireference electronic wave functions are employed. For
  the fully quantal description of the nuclear motion, we diabatize the PESs of the
  two and four lowest excited singlet and triplet states, respectively, within the
