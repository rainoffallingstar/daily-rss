description: The five-coordinate complex [RuCl(2)(PNP)] (1) was synthesized from the
  binuclear [RuCl(2)(p-cym)](2) with a PNP-type ligand (PNP = 3,6-di-tert-butyl-1,8-bis(diisopropylphosphino)methyl)-9H-carbazole
  - (Cbzdiphos ^(i) ^(Pr))H) in a toluene solution, within 20 h at 110 °C, producing
  a green solid, which was precipitated with a 1/1 mixture of n- pentane/HMDSO. The
  complex was characterized by NMR-¹H, ^(13)C, and ^(31)P{¹H}, mass spectroscopy-LIFDI,
  FTIR, UV/vis spectroscopy, and ...
