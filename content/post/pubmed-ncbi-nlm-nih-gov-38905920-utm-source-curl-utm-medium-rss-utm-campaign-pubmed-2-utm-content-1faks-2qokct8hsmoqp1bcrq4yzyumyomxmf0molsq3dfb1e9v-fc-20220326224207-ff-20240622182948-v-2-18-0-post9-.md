description: Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder caused by variations in the
  phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. Among the 3369 reported PAH variants, 33.7%
  are missense alterations. Unfortunately, 30% of these missense variants are classified
  as variants of unknown significance (VUS), posing challenges for genetic risk assessment.
  In our study, we focused on analyzing 836 missense PAH variants following the American
  College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular ...
