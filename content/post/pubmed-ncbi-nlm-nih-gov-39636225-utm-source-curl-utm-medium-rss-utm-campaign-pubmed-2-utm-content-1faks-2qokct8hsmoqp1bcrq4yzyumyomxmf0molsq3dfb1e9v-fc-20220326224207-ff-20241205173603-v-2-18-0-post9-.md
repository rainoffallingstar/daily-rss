description: This study investigates the potential clinical synergy between the poly(adenosine
  5'-diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor niraparib (Zejula®) and
  concomitant statins, exploring their combined effects on progression-free survival
  (PFS) in ovarian cancer patients. We retrospectively analysed niraparib registrational
  clinical trials in ovarian cancer to investigate potential interactions between
  niraparib and statins. In the PRIMA trial, patients receiving niraparib ...
