description: Type I interferons (IFN) are immune-stimulatory cytokines involved in
  antiviral and antitumor immune responses. They enhance the efficacy of immunogenic
  anticancer therapies such as radiotherapy by activating both innate and adaptive
  immune cells. Macrophages are one of the most abundant innate immune cells in the
  immune microenvironment of melanoma brain metastases (MBMs) and can exert potent
  immune-suppressive functions. Here, we investigate the potential of tumoral type
  I IFNs to ...
