description: The search for an iron analog of the established ruthenium-based catalysts
  containing methylene-extended 4,5-bis(diorganophosphinomethyl)acridine ligands,
  [FeHCl(CO)(L^(R))], resulted in the discovery of a bidentate coordination mode of
  these usually tridentate pincer ligands toward iron. The acridines nitrogen atom
  does not coordinate to iron, leading to the formation of iron diphos-type complexes
  with unusually large cis bite angles of up to 124째 as well as trans bite angles
  around 155째. ...
