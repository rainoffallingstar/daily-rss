description: 'CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported case of coexisting pulmonary
  adenocarcinoma and atypical carcinoid tumor with an ALK fusion only detected in
  the carcinoid component. The presence of ALK rearrangement in pulmonary carcinoid
  tumor is very uncommon, and there is currently no standard treatment for advanced
  stages. Therefore, comprehensive molecular testing, including ALK rearrangement
  analysis, should be recommended for mixed tumors exhibiting features of atypical
  carcinoid. ALK ...'
