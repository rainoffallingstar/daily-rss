description: Adults and infants form abstract categories of visual objects, but little
  is known about the development of global categorization. This study aims to characterize
  the development of very fast global categorization (living and non-living objects)
  and to determine whether and how low-level stimulus characteristics contribute to
  this response. Frequency tagging was used to characterize the development of global-level
  categorization in N = 69 infants (4, 7, 11 months), N = 22 children (5-6 ...
