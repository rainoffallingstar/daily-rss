description: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease characterized
  by genomic aberrations in oncogenes, cytogenetic abnormalities, and an aberrant
  epigenetic landscape. Nearly 50% of AML cases will relapse with current treatment.
  A major source of therapy resistance is the interaction of mesenchymal stroma with
  leukemic cells resulting in therapeutic protection. We aimed to determine pro-survival/anti-apoptotic
  protein networks involved in the stroma protection of leukemic cells. ...
