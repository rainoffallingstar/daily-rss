description: 'CONCLUSION: Higher metabolic tumor volume is significantly associated
  with worse overall survival and combined with TNM staging, it provides more precise
  information about the disease prognosis in locally advanced NSCLC treated with chemoradiotherapy
  compared to TNM alone. As a PET parameter with volumetric information, MTV represents
  a useful addition to ...'
