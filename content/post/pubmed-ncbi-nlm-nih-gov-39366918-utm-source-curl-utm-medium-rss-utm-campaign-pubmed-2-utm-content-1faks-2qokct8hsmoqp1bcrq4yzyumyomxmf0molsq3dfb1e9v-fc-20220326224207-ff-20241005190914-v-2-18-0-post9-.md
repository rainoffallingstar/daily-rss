description: Protein cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are regions that modulate the
  activity of a protein through intramolecular interactions. Kinases, pivotal enzymes
  in numerous biological processes, often undergo regulatory control via inhibitory
  interactions in cis. This study delves into the mechanisms of cis regulation in
  kinases mediated by CREs, employing a combined structural and sequence analysis.
  To accomplish this, we curated an extensive dataset of kinases featuring annotated
  CREs, organized ...
