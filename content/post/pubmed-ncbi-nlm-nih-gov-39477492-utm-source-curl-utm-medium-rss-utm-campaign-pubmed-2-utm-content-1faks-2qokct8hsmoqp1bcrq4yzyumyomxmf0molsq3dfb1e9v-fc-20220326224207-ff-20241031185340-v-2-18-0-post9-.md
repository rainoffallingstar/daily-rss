description: Radiopharmaceutical therapies (RPTs) based on fibroblast activation protein
  (FAP) and FAP inhibitors (FAPIs) are a new option for progressive metastatic cancer
  in patients pretreated multiple times. To date, published in-human data refer to
  initial experiences with β-emitting ^(90)Y- and ^(177)Lu-based RPT. However, the
  short tumor retention time of FAPI ligands is considered a major limitation of FAPI
  RPT. Therefore, fractionated FAPI RPT with ^(213)Bi, an α-emitter with a half-life
  of 46 ...
