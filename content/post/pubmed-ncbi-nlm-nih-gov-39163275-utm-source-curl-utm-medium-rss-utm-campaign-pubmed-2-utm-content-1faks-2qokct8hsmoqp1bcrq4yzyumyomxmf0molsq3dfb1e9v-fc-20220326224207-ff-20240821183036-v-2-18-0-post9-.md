description: 'This study aimed to investigate how electromyography (EMG) cluster analysis
  of the rectus femoris (RF) could help to better interpret gait analysis in patients
  with cerebral palsy (CP). The retrospective gait data of CP patients were categorized
  into two groups: initial examination (E1, 881 patients) and subsequent examination
