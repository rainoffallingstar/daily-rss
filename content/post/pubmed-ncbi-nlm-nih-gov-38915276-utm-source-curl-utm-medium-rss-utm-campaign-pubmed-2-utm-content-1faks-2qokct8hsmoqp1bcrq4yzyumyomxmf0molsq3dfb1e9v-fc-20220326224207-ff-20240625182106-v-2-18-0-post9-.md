description: FATP4 was thought to mediate intestinal lipid absorption which was disputed
  by a study using keratinocyte-Fatp4-rescued Fatp4^(-/-) mice. These knockouts when
  fed with a western diet showed elevated intestinal triglyceride (TG) and fatty-acid
  levels. To investigate a possible role of FATP4 on intestinal lipid processing,
  ent-Fatp4 (KO) mice were generated by Villin-Cre-specific inactivation of the Fatp4
  gene. We aimed to measure circulating and intestinal lipids in control and KO mice
