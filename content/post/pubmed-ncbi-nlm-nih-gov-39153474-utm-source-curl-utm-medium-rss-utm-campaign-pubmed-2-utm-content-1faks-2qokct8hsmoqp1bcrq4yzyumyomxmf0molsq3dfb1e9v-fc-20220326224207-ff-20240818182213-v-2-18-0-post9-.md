description: The individualization of chromosomes during early mitosis and their clustering
  upon exit from cell division are two key transitions that ensure efficient segregation
  of eukaryotic chromosomes. Both processes are regulated by the surfactant-like protein
  Ki-67, but how Ki-67 achieves these diametric functions has remained unknown. Here,
  we report that Ki-67 radically switches from a chromosome repellent to a chromosome
  attractant during anaphase in human cells. We show that Ki-67 ...
