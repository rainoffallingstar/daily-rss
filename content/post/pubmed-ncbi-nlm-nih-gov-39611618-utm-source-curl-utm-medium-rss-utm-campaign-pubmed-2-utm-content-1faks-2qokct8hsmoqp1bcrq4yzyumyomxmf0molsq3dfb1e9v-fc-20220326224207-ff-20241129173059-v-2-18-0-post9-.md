description: The TCA cycle serves as a central hub to balance catabolic and anabolic
  needs of the cell, where carbon moieties can either contribute to oxidative metabolism
  or support biosynthetic reactions. This differential TCA cycle engagement for glucose-derived
  carbon has been extensively studied in cultured cells, but the fate of fatty acid
  (FA)-derived carbons is poorly understood. To fill the knowledge gap, we have developed
  a strategy to culture cells with long-chain FAs without altering ...
