description: Protein-protein interaction experiments still yield many false positive
  interactions. The socioaffinity metric can distinguish true protein-protein interactions
  from noise based on available data. Here, we present WeSA (Weighted SocioAffinity),
  which considers large datasets of interaction proteomics data (IntAct, BioGRID,
  the BioPlex) to score human protein interactions and, in a statistically robust
  way, flag those (even from a single experiment) that are likely to be false positives.
