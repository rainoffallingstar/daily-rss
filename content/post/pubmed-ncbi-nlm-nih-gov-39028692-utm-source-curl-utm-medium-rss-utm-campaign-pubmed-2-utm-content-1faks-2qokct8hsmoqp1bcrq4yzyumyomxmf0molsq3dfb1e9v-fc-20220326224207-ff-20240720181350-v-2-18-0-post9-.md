description: Gliding motility proceeds with little changes in cell shape and often
  results from actively driven surface flows of adhesins binding to the extracellular
  environment. It allows for fast movement over surfaces or through tissue, especially
  for the eukaryotic parasites from the phylum apicomplexa, which includes the causative
  agents of the widespread diseases malaria and toxoplasmosis. We have developed a
  fully three-dimensional active particle theory which connects the self-organized,
