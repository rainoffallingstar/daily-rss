description: Babesiosis in sickle cell disease (SCD) is marked by severe anemia but
  the underlying red blood cell (RBC) rheological parameters remain largely undefined.
  Here, we describe altered RBC deformability from both primary (host RBC sickle hemoglobin
  mediated) and secondary changes (Babesia parasite infection mediated) to the RBC
  membrane using wild type AA, sickle trait AS and sickle SS RBCs. Our ektacytometry
  (LORRCA) analysis demonstrates that the changes in the host RBC bio-mechanical ...
