description: Both regulatory sequences and genome organization contribute to the production
  of diverse transcript isoforms, which can influence how genes, or sets of genes,
  are expressed. An efficient, modular approach is needed to generate the combinatorial
  complexity required to empirically test many combinations of different regulatory
  sequences and different gene orders. Golden Gate assembly provides such a tool for
  seamless one-pot cleavage and ligation, by using type IIS restriction enzymes, ...
