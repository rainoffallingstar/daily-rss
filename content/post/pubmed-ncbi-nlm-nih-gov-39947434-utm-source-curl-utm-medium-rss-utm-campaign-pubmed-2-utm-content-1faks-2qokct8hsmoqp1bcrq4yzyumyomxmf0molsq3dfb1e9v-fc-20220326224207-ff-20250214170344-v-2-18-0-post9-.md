  are needed with enhanced activity against amantadine- and rimantadine-resistant
  influenza A virus (IAV) strains containing the S31N variant of the viral M2 ion
  channel (M2^(S31N)). Here we tested 36 amantadine analogs against a panel of viruses
  containing either M2^(S31N) or the parental, M2 S31 wild-type variant (M2^(WT)).
  We found that several analogs, primarily those with sizeable lipophilic adducts,
