  can enhance mechanistic understanding and inform precision medicine strategies.
  Here, we perform a genome-wide association study of cortical tau quantified by positron
  emission tomography in 3046 participants from 12 independent studies. The CYP1B1-RMDN2
  locus is associated with tau deposition. The most significant signal is at rs2113389,
  explaining 4.3% of the variation in cortical tau, while APOE4 rs429358 accounts
