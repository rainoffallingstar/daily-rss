description: A lack of sustainability in the design of electronic components contributes
  to the current challenges of electronic waste and material sourcing. Common materials
  for electronics are prone to environmental, economic, and ethical problems in their
  sourcing, and at the end of their life often contribute to toxic and nonrecyclable
  waste. This study investigates the inkjet printing of flexible humidity sensors
  and includes biosourced and biodegradable materials to improve the sustainability
