description: Autophagy is a highly conserved process from yeast to mammals in which
  intracellular materials are engulfed by a double-membrane organelle called autophagosome
  and degrading materials by fusing with the lysosome. The process of autophagy is
  regulated by sequential recruitment and function of autophagy-related (Atg) proteins.
  Genetic hierarchical analyses show that the ULK1 complex comprised of ULK1-FIP200-ATG13-ATG101
