description: We propose a method for extracting the axial length of the human eye
  from high-resolution spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) retinal
  scans. The method evaluates the chromatic dispersion introduced by the anterior
  segment and the vitreous of the eye. By analyzing sub-spectral scans, we quantify
  the axial shift caused by dispersion and relate it to the thicknesses of the media
  passed by the OCT beam. The method depends on accurate k-linearization and pixel-to-wavenumber...
