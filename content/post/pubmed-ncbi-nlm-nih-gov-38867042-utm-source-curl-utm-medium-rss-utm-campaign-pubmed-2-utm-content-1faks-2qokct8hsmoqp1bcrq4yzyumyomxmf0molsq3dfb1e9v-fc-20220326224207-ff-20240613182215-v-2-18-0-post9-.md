description: DNA base damage is a major source of oncogenic mutations¹. Such damage
  can produce strand-phased mutation patterns and multiallelic variation through the
  process of lesion segregation². Here we exploited these properties to reveal how
  strand-asymmetric processes, such as replication and transcription, shape DNA damage
  and repair. Despite distinct mechanisms of leading and lagging strand replication^(3,4),
  we observe identical fidelity and damage tolerance for both strands. For small ...
