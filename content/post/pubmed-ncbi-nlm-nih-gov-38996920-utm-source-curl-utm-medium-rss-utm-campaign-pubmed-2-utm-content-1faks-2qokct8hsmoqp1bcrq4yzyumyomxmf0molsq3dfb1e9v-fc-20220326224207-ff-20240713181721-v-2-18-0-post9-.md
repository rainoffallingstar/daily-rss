description: Enterococcus faecalis is a versatile lactic acid bacterium with a large
  variety of implications for humans. While some strains of this species are pathobionts
  being resistant against most of the common antibiotics, other strains are regarded
  as biological protectants or even probiotics. Accordingly, E. faecalis strains largely
  differ in the size and content of their accessory genome. In this study, we describe
  the genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction of E. faecalis ATCC 19433, ...
