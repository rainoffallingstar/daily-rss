description: Precise and reliable predictive parameters to accurately identify chronic
  myeloid leukemia (CML) patients who can successfully discontinue their tyrosine
  kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment are lacking. One promising parameter is depth of
  molecular response measured by BCR::ABL1 digital PCR (dPCR). The aim of this study
  was to validate a previously described prediction cutoff of 0.0023%^(IS) and to
  assess the value of dPCR for treatment-free remission (TFR) prediction in relation
  to other ...
