description: The gut microbiota influences human health and the development of chronic
  diseases. However, our understanding of potentially protective or harmful microbe-host
  interactions at the molecular level is still in its infancy. To gain further insights
  into the hidden gut metabolome and its impact, we identified a cryptic non-ribosomal
  peptide BGC in the genome of Bacillus cereus DSM 28590 from the mouse intestine
  ( www.dsmz.de/miBC ), which was predicted to encode a thiazol(in)e substructure.
