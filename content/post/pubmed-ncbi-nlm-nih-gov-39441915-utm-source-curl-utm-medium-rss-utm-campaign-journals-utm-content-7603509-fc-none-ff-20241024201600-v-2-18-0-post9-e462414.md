description: Soluble B-cell maturation antigen (sBCMA) is overexpressed on multiple
  myeloma (MM) cells. We investigated whether sBCMA levels correlated with other myeloma
  tumor volume indicators and its utility in monitoring oligo-secretory/non-secretory
  (O-S/Non-S) MM. In 115 patients with newly diagnosed MM, sBCMA was compared with
  M-protein levels, bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs), circulating tumor cells (CTCs),
  and total diffusion volume (tDV; estimated by whole-body diffusion-weighted ...
