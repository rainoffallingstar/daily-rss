description: Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is mainly found on the surface of
  activated fibroblasts but is not expressed on the surface of inactive fibroblasts.
  Selective FAP inhibitors (FAPI), which are coupled to a radioactive tracer, can
  be used to quantify profibrotic and proinflammatory fibroblasts in patients using
  FAPI positron emission tomography (PET) computed tomography (CT). Following initial
  applications in neoplastic diseases, FAPI-PET/CT is also increasingly being applied
