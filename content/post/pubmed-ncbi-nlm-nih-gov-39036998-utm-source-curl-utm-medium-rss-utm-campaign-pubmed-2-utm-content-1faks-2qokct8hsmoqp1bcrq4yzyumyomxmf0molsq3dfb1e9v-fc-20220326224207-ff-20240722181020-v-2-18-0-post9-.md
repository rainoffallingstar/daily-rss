description: We present a new set of computational tools that enable accurate and
  widely applicable 3D segmentation of nuclei in various 3D digital organs. We have
  developed an approach for ground truth generation and iterative training of 3D nuclear
  segmentation models, which we applied to popular CellPose, PlantSeg and StarDist
  algorithms. We provide two high-quality models trained on plant nuclei that enable
  3D segmentation of nuclei in datasets obtained from fixed or live samples, acquired
  from ...
