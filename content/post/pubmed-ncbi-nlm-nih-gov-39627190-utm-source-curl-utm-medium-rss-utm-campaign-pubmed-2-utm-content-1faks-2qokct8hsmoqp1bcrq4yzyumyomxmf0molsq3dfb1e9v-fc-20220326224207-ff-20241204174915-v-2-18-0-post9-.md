description: Adoptive T-cell immunotherapy holds great promise for the treatment of
  viral complications in immunocompromised patients resistant to standard anti-viral
  strategies. We present a retrospective analysis of 78 patients from 19 hospitals
  across Australia and New Zealand, treated over the last 15 years with "off-the-shelf"
  allogeneic T cells directed to a combination of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus
  (CMV), BK polyomavirus (BKV), John Cunningham virus (JCV) and/or adenovirus (AdV)
