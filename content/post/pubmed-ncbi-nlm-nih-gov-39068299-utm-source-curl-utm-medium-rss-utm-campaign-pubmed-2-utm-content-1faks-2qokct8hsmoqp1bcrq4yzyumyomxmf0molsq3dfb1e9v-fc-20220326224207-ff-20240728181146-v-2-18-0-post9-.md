description: Accurate intraoperative assessment of organ perfusion is a pivotal determinant
  in preserving organ function e.g. during kidney surgery including partial nephrectomy
  or kidney transplantation. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has great potential to objectively
  describe and quantify this perfusion as opposed to conventional surrogate techniques
  such as ultrasound flowmeter, indocyanine green or the subjective eye of the surgeon.
  An established live porcine model under general anesthesia received ...
