description: The human choroid plexus (CP) is the location of the blood-cerebrospinal
  fluid (CSF) barrier (BCSFB). Whereas the epithelial cells of the CP mainly contribute
  to the formation of the BCSFB, the vessels of the CP are built by fenestrated endothelial
  cells. Still, the CP endothelium can contribute to barrier function. By ectopic
  expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) in primary human CP
  endothelial cells (HCPEnCs), we recently generated and characterized immortalized
