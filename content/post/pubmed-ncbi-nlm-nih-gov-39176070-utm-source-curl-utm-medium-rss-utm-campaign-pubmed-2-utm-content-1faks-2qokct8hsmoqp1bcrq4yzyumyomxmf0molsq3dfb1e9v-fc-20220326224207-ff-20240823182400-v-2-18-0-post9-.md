description: T cell-derived cancers are hallmarked by heterogeneity, aggressiveness,
  and poor clinical outcomes. Available targeted therapies are severely limited due
  to a lack of target antigens that allow discrimination of malignant from healthy
  T cells. Here, we report a novel approach for the treatment of T cell diseases based
  on targeting the clonally rearranged T cell receptor displayed by the cancerous
  T cell population. As a proof of concept, we identified an antibody with unique
