description: Structural brain aging has demonstrated strong inter-individual heterogeneity
  and mirroring patterns with brain development. However, due to the lack of large-scale
  longitudinal neuroimaging studies, most of the existing research focused on the
  cross-sectional changes of brain aging. In this investigation, we present a data-driven
  approach that incorporate both cross-sectional changes and longitudinal trajectories
  of structural brain aging and identified two brain aging patterns among ...
