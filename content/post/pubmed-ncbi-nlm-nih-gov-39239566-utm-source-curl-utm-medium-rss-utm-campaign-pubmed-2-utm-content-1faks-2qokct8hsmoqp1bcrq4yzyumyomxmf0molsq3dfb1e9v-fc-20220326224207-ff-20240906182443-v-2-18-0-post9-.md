description: Introduction. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infections continue to
  have a high mortality and morbidity burden globally. Interferon-gamma release assays
  such as Quantiferon Gold Plus (QFG-Plus) aid in diagnosis of latent TB but diagnosis
  of pleural TB remains challenging. We present a case of active pleural MTB infection
  with reversion from positive to negative of IGRA result as well as negative Xpert
  MTB/RIF Ultra PCR result from tissues obtained from pleural biopsy. Case summary.
