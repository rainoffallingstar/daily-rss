description: SUMMARYPolintons are 15-20 kb-long self-synthesizing transposons that
  are widespread in eukaryotic, and in particular protist, genomes. Apart from a transposase
  and a protein-primed DNA polymerase, polintons encode homologs of major and minor
  jelly-roll capsid proteins, DNA-packaging ATPases, and proteases involved in capsid
  maturation of diverse eukaryotic viruses of kingdom Bamfordvirae. Given the conservation
  of these structural and morphogenetic proteins among polintons, these elements ...
