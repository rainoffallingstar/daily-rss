description: Foam cells in atheroma are engorged with lipid droplets (LDs) that contain
  esters of regulatory lipids whose metabolism remains poorly understood. LD-associated
  hydrolase (LDAH) has a lipase structure and high affinity for LDs of foam cells.
  Using knockout and transgenic mice of both sexes, here we show that LDAH inhibits
  atherosclerosis development and promotes stable lesion architectures. Broad and
  targeted lipidomic analyzes of primary macrophages and comparative lipid profiling
