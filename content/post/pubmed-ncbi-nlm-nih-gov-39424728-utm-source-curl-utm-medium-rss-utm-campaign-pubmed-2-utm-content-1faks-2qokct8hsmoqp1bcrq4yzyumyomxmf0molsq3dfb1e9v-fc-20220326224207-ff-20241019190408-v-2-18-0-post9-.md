description: Response to anticancer agents is often restricted to subsets of patients.
  Recognition of factors underlying this heterogeneity and identification of biomarkers
  associated with response to drugs would greatly improve the efficacy of drug treatment.
  Platforms that can comprehensively map cellular response to compounds in high-throughput
  provide a unique tool to identify associated biomarkers and provide hypotheses for
  mechanisms underlying variable response. Such screens can be performed on ...
