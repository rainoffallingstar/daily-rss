description: Clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance (CCUS) represents a distinct
  disease entity characterized by myeloid-related somatic mutations with a variant
  allele fraction of ≥2% in individuals with unexplained cytopenia(s) but without
  a myeloid neoplasm (MN). Notably, CCUS carries a risk of progressing to MN, particularly
  in cases featuring high-risk mutations. Understanding CCUS requires dedicated studies
  to elucidate its risk factors and natural history. Our analysis of 357 CCUS ...
