description: The development of redox-sensitive molecular fluorescent probes for the
  detection of redox changes in Plasmodium falciparum-parasitized red blood cells
  remains of interest due to the limitations of current genetically encoded biosensors.
  This study describes the design, screening and synthesis of new pro-fluorophores
  based on flavylium azido dyes coupled by click chemistry to alkynyl analogues of
  plasmodione oxide, the key metabolite of the potent redox-active antimalarial plasmodione.
