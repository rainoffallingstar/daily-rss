description: Several (inter)national longitudinal dementia observational datasets
  encompassing demographic information, neuroimaging, biomarkers, neuropsychological
  evaluations, and muti-omics data, have ushered in a new era of potential for integrating
  machine learning (ML) into dementia research and clinical practice. ML, with its
  proficiency in handling multi-modal and high-dimensional data, has emerged as an
  innovative technique to facilitate early diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and
  to predict ...
