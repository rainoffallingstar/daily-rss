description: Axial elongation continues in highly myopic adult eyes, even in the absence
  of pathologic changes such as posterior staphyloma or chorioretinal atrophy. This
  ongoing axial elongation leads to structural changes in the macular and peripapillary
  regions, including chorioretinal thinning, reduced vascular perfusion and optic
  disc tilting and rotation, among others. These alterations can affect the acquisition
  and interpretation of optical coherence tomography, optical coherence ...
