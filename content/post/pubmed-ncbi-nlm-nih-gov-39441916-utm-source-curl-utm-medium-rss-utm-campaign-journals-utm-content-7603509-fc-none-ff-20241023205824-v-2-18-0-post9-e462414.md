description: High-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 rearrangements (HGBCL-DH-BCL2),
  or 'double-hit lymphoma,' has been associated with a high risk of central nervous
  system (CNS) relapse. However, historic estimates are impacted by selection bias.
  We report CNS relapse rates associated with HGBCL-DH-BCL2 from a population-based
  cohort with complete fluorescence in situ hybridization testing, as well as diffuse
  large B-cell lymphoma morphology (DLBCL) tumors expressing the dark-zone gene ...
