description: Stress-protective effects have been reported for M. vaccae NCTC 11659
  and M. vaccae ATCC 15483^(T). However, it remains to be investigated whether also
  closely related rapidly growing environmental saprophytic non-tuberculous mycobacteria
  (NTM) species have protective effects against the negative consequences of chronic
  psychosocial stress. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to assess whether
