description: Precision oncology offers new cancer treatment options, yet sequencing
  methods vary in type and scope. In this study, we compared whole-exome/whole-genome
  (WES/WGS) and transcriptome sequencing (TS) with broad panel sequencing by resequencing
  the same tumor DNA and RNA as well as normal tissue DNA for germline assessment,
  from 20 patients with rare or advanced tumors, who were originally sequenced by
  WES/WGS ± TS within the DKFZ/NCT/DKTK MASTER program from 2015 to 2020. Molecular
