description: Melanoma has long been a difficult malignancy to treat with low response
  rates to standard chemotherapies. In recent years, the use of immune checkpoint
  inhibitors have demonstrated promising results, paving the way for the use of the
  rapidly developing novel immune targeting therapies. In this review, we look beyond
  immune checkpoint inhibitor treatments and summarize several emerging treatment
  strategies for melanoma, including neoantigen vaccines, conventional antibody drug-conjugates,
