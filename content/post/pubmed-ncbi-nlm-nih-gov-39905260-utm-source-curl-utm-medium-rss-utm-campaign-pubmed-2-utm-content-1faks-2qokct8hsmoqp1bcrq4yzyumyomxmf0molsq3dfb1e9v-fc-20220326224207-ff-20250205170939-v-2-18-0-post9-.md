description: Cell division drives somatic evolution but is challenging to quantify.
  We developed a framework to count cell divisions with DNA replication-related mutations
  in polyguanine homopolymers. Analyzing 505 samples from 37 patients, we studied
  the milestones of colorectal cancer evolution. Primary tumors diversify at ~250
  divisions from the founder cell, while distant metastasis divergence occurs significantly
  later, at ~500 divisions. Notably, distant but not lymph node metastases originate
