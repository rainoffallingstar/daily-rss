description: Progressive gait impairment is common among aging adults. Remote phenotyping
  of gait during daily living has the potential to quantify gait alterations and evaluate
  the effects of interventions that may prevent disability in the aging population.
  Here, we developed ElderNet, a self-supervised learning model for gait detection
  from wrist-worn accelerometer data. Validation involved two diverse cohorts, including
  over 1000 participants without gait labels, as well as 83 participants with ...
