description: Two-photon microscopy (2PM) has become an important tool in biology to
  study the structure and function of intact tissues in vivo. However, adult mammalian
  tissues such as the mouse brain are highly scattering, thereby putting fundamental
  limits on the achievable imaging depth, which typically reside at around 600-800
  μm. In principle, shifting both the excitation as well as (fluorescence) emission
  light to the shortwave near-infrared (SWIR, 1000-1700 nm) region promises substantially
