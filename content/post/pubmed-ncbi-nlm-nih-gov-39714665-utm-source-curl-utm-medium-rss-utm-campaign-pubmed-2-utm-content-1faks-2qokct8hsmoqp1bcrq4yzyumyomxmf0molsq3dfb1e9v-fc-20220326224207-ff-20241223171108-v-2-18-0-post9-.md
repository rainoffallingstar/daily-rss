description: Stable ^{205}Tl ions have the lowest known energy threshold for capturing
  electron neutrinos (ν_{e}) of E_{ν_{e}}≥50.6 keV. The Lorandite Experiment (LOREX),
  proposed in the 1980s, aims at obtaining the longtime averaged solar neutrino flux
  by utilizing natural deposits of Tl-bearing lorandite ores. To determine the ν_{e}
  capture cross section, it is required to know the strength of the weak transition
  connecting the ground state of ^{205}Tl and the 2.3 keV first excited state in ^{205}Pb.
