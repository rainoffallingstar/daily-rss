description: Individuals living with HIV are at a higher risk for developing human
  papillomavirus-driven oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPV+OPSCC). There are
  no methods for early detection; however, HPV16 E6 antibodies have been identified
  as a promising early marker. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence
  of HPV16 E6 antibodies among men living with HIV, with secondary objectives of analyzing
  clinical and serologic predictors of HPV16 E6 seropositivity. Banked blood ...
