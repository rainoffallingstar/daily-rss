description: We examined the effect of botulinum toxin-A on upper limb impairments
  and activity limitations in chronic stroke. This study is a secondary analysis of
  control group data from a national, multicenter, Phase III randomized trial with
  a masked outcome assessment. We studied 71 stroke survivors who received a botulinum
  toxin-A injection in any muscle(s) that crosses the wrist due to significant spasticity
  after a stroke greater than 3 months previously. We measured upper limb activity,
