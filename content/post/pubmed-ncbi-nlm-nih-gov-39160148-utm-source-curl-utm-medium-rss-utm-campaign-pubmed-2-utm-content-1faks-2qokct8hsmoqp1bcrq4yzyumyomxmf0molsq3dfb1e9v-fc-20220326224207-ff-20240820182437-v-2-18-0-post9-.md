description: Replication of influenza viral RNA depends on at least two viral polymerases,
  a parental replicase and an encapsidase, and cellular factor ANP32. ANP32 comprises
  an LRR domain and a long C-terminal low complexity acidic region (LCAR). Here we
  present evidence suggesting that ANP32 is recruited to the replication complex as
  an electrostatic chaperone that stabilises the encapsidase moiety within apo-polymerase
  symmetric dimers that are distinct for influenza A and B polymerases. The ANP32
