description: Loss of anticancer NK cell function in AML patients is associated with
  fatal disease progression and remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that
  AML-blasts isolated from patients rapidly inhibit NK cell function and escape NK
  cell-mediated killing. Transcriptome analysis of NK cells exposed to AML-blasts
  revealed increased CREM expression and transcriptional activity, indicating enhanced
  cAMP signalling, confirmed by uniform production of the cAMP-inducing prostanoid
  PGE2 by ...
