  follicular lymphoma (FL) using molecular profiling remains challenging. FL tumors
  from patients treated in the RELEVANCE trial with rituximab-chemotherapy (R-chemo)
  or rituximab-lenalidomide (R2) were analyzed using RNA-sequencing, DNA-sequencing,
  immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization. Unsupervised
