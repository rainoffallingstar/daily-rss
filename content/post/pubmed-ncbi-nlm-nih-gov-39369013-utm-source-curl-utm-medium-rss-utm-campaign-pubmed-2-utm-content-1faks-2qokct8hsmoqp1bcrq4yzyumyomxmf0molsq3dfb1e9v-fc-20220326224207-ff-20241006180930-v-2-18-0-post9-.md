description: Biofilm formation by Shewanella oneidensis has been extensively studied
  under oxic conditions; however, relatively little is known about biofilm formation
  under anoxic conditions and how biofilm architecture and composition can positively
  influence current generation in bioelectrochemical systems. In this study, we utilized
  a recently developed microfluidic biofilm analysis setup with automated 3D imaging
  to investigate the effects of extracellular electron acceptors and synthetic ...
