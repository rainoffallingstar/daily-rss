description: Peptidoglycan (PG), a mesh-like structure which is the primary component
  of the bacterial cell wall, is crucial to maintain cell integrity and shape. While
  most bacteria rely on penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) for crosslinking, some
  species also employ LD-transpeptidases (LDTs). Unlike PBPs, the essentiality and
  biological functions of LDTs remain largely unclear. The Hyphomicrobiales order
  of the Alphaproteobacteria, known for their polar growth, have PG which is unusually
  rich ...
