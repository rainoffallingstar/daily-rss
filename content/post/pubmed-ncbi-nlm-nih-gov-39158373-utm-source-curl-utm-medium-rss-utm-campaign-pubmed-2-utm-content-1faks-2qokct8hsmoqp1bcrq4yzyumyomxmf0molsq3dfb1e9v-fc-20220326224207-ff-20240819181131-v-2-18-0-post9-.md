description: Herein, we report the synthesis of seleno-substituted chromenes from
  selenoalkynes and phenols. In this cascade reaction, the applied gold catalyst not
  only functions as a p-acid, but also as a Lewis acid, enabling the propargylic substitution
  in the first step to connect the oxygen carbon bond. Under the optimal reaction
  condition a total of 26 chromenes were accessible by this modular access. During
  scale up experiments, the hydrolysis of the vinylselenium substructure to the ...
