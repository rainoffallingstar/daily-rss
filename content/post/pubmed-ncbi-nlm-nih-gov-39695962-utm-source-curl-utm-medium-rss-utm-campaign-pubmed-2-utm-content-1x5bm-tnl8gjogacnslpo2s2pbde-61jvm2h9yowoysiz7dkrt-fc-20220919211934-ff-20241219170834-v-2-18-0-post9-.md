  the characterization of spatial structures for different tissues. Many decomposition
  methods have been proposed to depict the cellular distribution within tissues. However,
  existing computational methods struggle to balance spatial continuity in cell distribution
  with the preservation of cell-specific characteristics. To address this, we propose
  Spall, a novel decomposition network that integrates scRNA-seq data with SRT ...
