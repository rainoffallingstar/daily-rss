description: This study provides an objective comparison of cranial computed tomography
  (CT) imaging quality and radiation dose between photon counting detectors (PCCTs)
  and energy-integrated detectors (EIDs). We retrospectively analyzed 158 CT scans
  from 76 patients, employing both detector types on the same individuals to ensure
  a consistent comparison. Our analysis focused on the Computed Tomography Dose Index
  and the Dose-Length Product together with the contrast-to-noise ratio and the ...
