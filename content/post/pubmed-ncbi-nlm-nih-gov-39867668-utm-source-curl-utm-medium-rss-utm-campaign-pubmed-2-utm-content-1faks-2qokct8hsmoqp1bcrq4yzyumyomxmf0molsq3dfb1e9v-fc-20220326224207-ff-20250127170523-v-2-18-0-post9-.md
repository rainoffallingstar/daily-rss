description: Here, we present Link-Seq, a highly efficient droplet microfluidic method
  for combined sequencing of antibody-encoding genes and the transcriptome of individual
  B cells at large scale. The method is based on 3' barcoding of the transcriptome
  and subsequent single-molecule PCR in droplets, which freely shift the barcode along
  specific gene regions, such as the antibody heavy- and light-chain genes. Using
  the immune repertoire of COVID-19 patients and healthy donors as a model system,
  we obtain ...
