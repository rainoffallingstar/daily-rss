description: Inert gas washout methods have been shown to detect pathological changes
  in the small airways that occur in the early stages of obstructive lung diseases
  such as asthma and COPD. Numerical lung models support the analysis of characteristic
  washout curves, but are limited in their ability to simulate the complexity of lung
  anatomy over an appropriate time period. Therefore, the interpretation of patient-specific
  washout data remains a challenge. A new numerical lung model is presented in ...
