description: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies allow for comprehensive characterization
  of gene expression patterns in the context of tissue microenvironment. However,
  accurately identifying domains with spatial coherence in both gene expression and
  histology in situ and effectively integrating data from multi-sample remains challenging.
  Here, we propose ResST, a graph self-supervised residual learning model based on
  graph neural network and Margin Disparity Discrepancy (MDD) theory. ResST ...
