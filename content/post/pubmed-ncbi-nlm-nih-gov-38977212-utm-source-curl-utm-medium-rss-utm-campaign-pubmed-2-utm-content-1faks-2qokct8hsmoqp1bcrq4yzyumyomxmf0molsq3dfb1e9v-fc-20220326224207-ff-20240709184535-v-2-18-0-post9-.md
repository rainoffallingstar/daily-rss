description: Cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADR) collectively are delayed drug
  reactions such as morbilliform drug eruption (MDE) and severe cutaneous adverse
  reactions (SCAR). Whereas MDE may wane over time, be the result of drug viral interactions
  and be amenable to slow reintroduction or rechallenge, SCAR are HLA class I restricted,
  T-cell mediated reactions that demonstrate durable immunity and warrant lifelong
  avoidance. SCAR such as drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ...
