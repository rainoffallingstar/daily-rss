description: We aimed to develop a machine-learning based predictive model to identify
  30-day readmission risk in Acute heart failure (AHF) patients. In this study 2232
  patients hospitalized with AHF were included. The variance inflation factor value
  and 5-fold cross-validation were used to select vital clinical variables. Five machine
  learning algorithms with good performance were applied to develop models, and the
  discrimination ability was comprehensively evaluated by sensitivity, specificity,
  and ...
