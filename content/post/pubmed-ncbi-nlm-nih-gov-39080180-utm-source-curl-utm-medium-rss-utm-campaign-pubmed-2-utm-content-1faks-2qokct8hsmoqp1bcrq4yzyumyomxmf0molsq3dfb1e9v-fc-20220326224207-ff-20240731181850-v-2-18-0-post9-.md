description: Chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy has been established in the
  treatment of various B cell malignancies. However, translating this therapeutic
  effect to treat solid tumors has been challenging because of their inter-tumoral
  as well as intratumoral heterogeneity and immunosuppressive microenvironment. Local
  interventions, such as surgery, radiotherapy, local ablation, and locoregional drug
  delivery, can enhance chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy in solid tumors by
