description: Malignant Central Airway Obstruction (MCAO) encompasses significant and
  symptomatic narrowing of the central airways that can occur due to primary lung
  cancer or metastatic disease. Therapeutic bronchoscopy is associated with high technical
  success and symptomatic relief and includes a wide range of airway interventions
  including airway stents. Published literature suggests that stenting practices vary
  significantly across the world primarily due to lack of guidance. This document
