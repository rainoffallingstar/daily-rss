  encoding partial D antigen expression, but unexpected anti-D is also found in the
  plasma of patients with sickle cell disease who have conventional RHD gene(s) and
  are transfused with units from Black donors. These anti-D are likely stimulated
  by variant Rh expressed on donor cells, however patients with anti-D, regardless
  of cause, are transfused for a lifetime with D-negative (Rh-negative) blood. This
