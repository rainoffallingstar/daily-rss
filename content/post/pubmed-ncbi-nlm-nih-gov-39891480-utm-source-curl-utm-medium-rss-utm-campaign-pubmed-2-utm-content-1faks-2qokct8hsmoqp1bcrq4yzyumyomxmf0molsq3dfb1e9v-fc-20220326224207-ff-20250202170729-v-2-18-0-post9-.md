description: Proprotein convertase 1/3 (PC1/3), encoded by PCSK1, is expressed in
  neuronal and endocrine cell types, where it activates a number of protein precursors
  that play roles in energy homeostasis. Biallelic PCSK1 loss-of-function mutations
  cause a polyendocrinopathy; a total of 34 patients were reported. An infant with
  congenital malabsorptive diarrhea of all carbohydrates underwent exome sequencing
  (ES), with particular consideration of PC1/3 deficiency, but no mutations were found.
