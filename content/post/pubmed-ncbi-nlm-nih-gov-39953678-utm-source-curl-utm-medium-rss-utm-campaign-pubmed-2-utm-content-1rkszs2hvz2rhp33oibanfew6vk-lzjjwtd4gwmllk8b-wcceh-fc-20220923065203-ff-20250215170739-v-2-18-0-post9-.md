description: A better understanding of positron emission tomography (PET) response
  in nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (nLPHL) is critical for incorporating
  PET into prospective trials. PET scans from Children's Oncology Group study AHOD03P1
  for patients less than 22 years with low-risk nLPHL, treated with three cycles of
  doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy, were retrospectively
  reviewed and assigned Deauville 5-point scale (5PS) scores. Five-year ...
