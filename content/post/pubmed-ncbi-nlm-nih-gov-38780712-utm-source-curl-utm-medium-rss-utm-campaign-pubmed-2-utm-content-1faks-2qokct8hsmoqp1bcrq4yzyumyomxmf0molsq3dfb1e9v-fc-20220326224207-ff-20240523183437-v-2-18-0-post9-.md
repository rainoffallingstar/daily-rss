description: Myocardial work (MW) derived from pressure-strain loops is a novel non-invasive
  tool to assess left ventricular (LV) function, incorporating global longitudinal
  strain (GLS) by speckle tracking echocardiography and non-invasively assessed blood
  pressure. Studies on the role of MW in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) are still limited.
  Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential value of MW for predicting
  adverse outcomes in patients with DCM. 116 consecutive patients with DCM ...
