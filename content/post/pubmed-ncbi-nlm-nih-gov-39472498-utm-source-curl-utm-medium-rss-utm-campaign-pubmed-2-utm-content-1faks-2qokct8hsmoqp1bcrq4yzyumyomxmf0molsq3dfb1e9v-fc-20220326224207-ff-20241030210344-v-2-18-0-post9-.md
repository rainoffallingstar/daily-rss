description: GPA33 is a promising surface antigen for targeted therapy in colorectal
  cancer (CRC). It is expressed almost exclusively in CRC and intestinal epithelia.
  However, previous clinical studies have not achieved expected response rates. We
  investigated GPA33 expression and regulation in CRC and developed a GPA33-targeted
  cellular therapy. We examined GPA33 expression in CRC cohorts using immunohistochemistry
  and immunofluorescence. We analyzed GPA33 regulation by interference with oncogenic
