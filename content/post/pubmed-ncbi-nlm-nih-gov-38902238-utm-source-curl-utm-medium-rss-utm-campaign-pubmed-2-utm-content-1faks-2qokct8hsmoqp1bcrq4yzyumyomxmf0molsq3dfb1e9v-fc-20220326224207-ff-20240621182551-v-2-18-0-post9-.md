description: Mitochondria require an extensive proteome to maintain a variety of metabolic
  reactions, and changes in cellular demand depend on rapid adaptation of the mitochondrial
  protein composition. The TOM complex, the organellar entry gate for mitochondrial
  precursors in the outer membrane, is a target for cytosolic kinases to modulate
  protein influx. DYRK1A phosphorylation of the carrier import receptor TOM70 at Ser91
  enables its efficient docking and thus transfer of precursor proteins to the ...
