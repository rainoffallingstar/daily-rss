description: 'Objectives: This laboratory study aims to assess the effects of misaligning
  different trifocal intraocular lenses (IOLs) under varying spectral and corneal
  spherical aberration (SA) conditions. Methods: With an IOL metrology device under
  monochromatic and polychromatic conditions, the following models were studied: AT
  ELANA 841P, AT LISA Tri 839MP, FineVision HP POD F, Acrysof IQ PanOptix, and Tecnis
  Synergy ZFR00V. The SA was simulated using an aberration-free and average-SA cornea.
