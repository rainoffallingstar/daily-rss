description: Next week, Sam will be in Valencia (Spain) to present our work on Data
  Augmentation for Imbaladed Regression In this work, we consider the problem of imbalanced
  data in a regression framework when the imbalanced phenomenon concerns continuous
  or discrete covariates. Such a situation can lead to biases in the estimates. In
  this case, we propose a data augmentation algorithm that combines a weighted resampling
  (WR) and a data augmentation (DA) procedure. In a first step, the DA procedure permits
  exploring a wider support &#8230; <a href="https://freakonometrics.hypotheses.org/66719"
