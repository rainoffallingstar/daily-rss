  during pregnancy or by postnatal exposure of very preterm infants. Corticosteroids
  are administered to pregnant women at risk of preterm delivery in order to reduce
  neonatal morbidity and mortality. In addition, high-dose corticosteroid exposure
  of very preterm infants regularly serves to maintain blood pressure and to prevent
