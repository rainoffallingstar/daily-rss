description: Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) is a prompt and non-invasive imaging modality
  helpful in detecting pathological abnormalities within the retina and the choroid.
  This narrative review and case series provides an overview on the current application
  of FAF in posterior and panuveitis. The literature was reviewed for articles on
  lesion characteristics on FAF of specific posterior and panuveitis entities as well
  as benefits and limitations of FAF for diagnosing and monitoring disease. ...
