description: Glioblastomas are invasive brain tumors with high therapeutic resistance.
  Neuron-to-glioma synapses have been shown to promote glioblastoma progression. However,
  a characterization of tumor-connected neurons has been hampered by a lack of technologies.
  Here, we adapted retrograde tracing using rabies viruses to investigate and manipulate
  neuron-tumor networks. Glioblastoma rapidly integrated into neural circuits across
  the brain, engaging in widespread functional communication, with ...
