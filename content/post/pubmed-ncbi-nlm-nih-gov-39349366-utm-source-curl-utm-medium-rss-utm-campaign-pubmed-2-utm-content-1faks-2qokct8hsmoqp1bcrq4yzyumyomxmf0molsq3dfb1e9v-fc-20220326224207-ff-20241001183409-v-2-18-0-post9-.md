description: Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a severe autoimmune bullous dermatosis that
  is characterized by autoantibodies against epidermal adhesion proteins causing painful
  mucosal and skin blistering. Standard treatments for PV include corticosteroids,
  steroid-sparing immunosuppressants, or intravenous monoclonal anti-CD20-antibody
  therapy. The European guidelines suggest high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)
  therapy as a promising approach for severe or treatment-resistant cases. We report
