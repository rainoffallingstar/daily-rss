description: Catatonia is a severe psychomotor disorder characterized by motor, affective
  and cognitive-behavioral abnormalities. Although previous magnetic resonance imaging
  (MRI) studies suggested white matter (WM) dysconnectivity in the pathogenesis of
  catatonia, it is unclear whether microstructural alterations of WM tracts connecting
  psychomotor regions might contribute to a better classification of catatonia patients.
  Here, diffusion-weighted MRI data were collected from two independent ...
