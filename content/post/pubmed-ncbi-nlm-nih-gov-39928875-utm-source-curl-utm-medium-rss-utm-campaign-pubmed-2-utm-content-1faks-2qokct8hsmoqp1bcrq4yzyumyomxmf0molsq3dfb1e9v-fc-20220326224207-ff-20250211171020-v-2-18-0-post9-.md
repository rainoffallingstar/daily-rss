description: Positive-strand RNA viruses of the order Nidovirales have the largest
  known RNA genomes of vertebrate and invertebrate viruses with 36.7 and 41.1 kb,
  respectively. The acquisition of a proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) by an ancestral
  nidovirus enabled crossing of the 20 kb barrier. Other factors constraining genome
  size variations in nidoviruses remain poorly defined. We assemble 76 genome sequences
  of invertebrate nidoviruses from >500.000 published transcriptome experiments and
