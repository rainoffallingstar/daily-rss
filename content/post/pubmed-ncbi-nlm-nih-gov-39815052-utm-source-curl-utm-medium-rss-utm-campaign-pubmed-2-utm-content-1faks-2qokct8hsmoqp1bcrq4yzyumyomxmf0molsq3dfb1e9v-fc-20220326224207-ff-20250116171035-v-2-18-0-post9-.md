description: In the MAIA study (median follow-up, 56.2 months), daratumumab plus lenalidomide
  and dexamethasone (D-Rd) significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS)
  and overall survival versus lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) alone in transplant-ineligible
  newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM). In this post hoc analysis of clinically
  important subgroups in MAIA (median follow-up, 64.5 months), transplant-ineligible
  patients with NDMM were randomized 1:1 to D-Rd or Rd. The primary endpoint ...
