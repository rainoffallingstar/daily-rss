  of medium-mass and heavy nuclei using the valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization
  group with chiral effective field theory interactions and currents. Focusing on
  near doubly magic nuclei from oxygen to bismuth, we have found that the leading
  two-body currents globally improve the agreement with experimental magnetic moments.
