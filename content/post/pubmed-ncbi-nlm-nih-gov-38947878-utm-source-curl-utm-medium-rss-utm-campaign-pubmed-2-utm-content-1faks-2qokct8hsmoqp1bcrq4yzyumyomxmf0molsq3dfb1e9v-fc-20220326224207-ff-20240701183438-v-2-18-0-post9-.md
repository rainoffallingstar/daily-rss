description: Neuroinflammation is initiated through microglial activation and cytokine
  release which can be induced through lipopolysaccharide treatment (LPS) leading
  to a transcriptional cascade culminating in the differential expression of target
  proteins. These differentially expressed proteins can then be packaged into extracellular
  vesicles (EVs), a form of cellular communication, further propagating the neuroinflammatory
  response over long distances. Despite this, the EV proteome in the ...
