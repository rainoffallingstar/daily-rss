description: Central nervous system neuroblastoma with FOXR2 activation (NB-FOXR2)
  is a high-grade tumor of the brain hemispheres and a newly identified molecular
  entity. Tumors express dual neuronal and glial markers, leading to frequent misdiagnoses,
  and limited information exists on the role of FOXR2 in their genesis. To identify
  their cellular origins, we profiled the transcriptomes of NB-FOXR2 tumors at the
  bulk and single-cell levels and integrated these profiles with large single-cell
  references ...
