  failure syndrome type 1 (ILFS1)) has a multisystemic phenotype including fever-associated
  acute liver failure (ALF), chronic neurologic abnormalities, and encephalopathic
  episodes. In order to better characterize encephalopathic episodes and MRI changes,
  35 cranial MRIs from 13 individuals with LARS1 deficiency were systematically assessed
  and neurological phenotype was analyzed. All individuals had developmental delay
