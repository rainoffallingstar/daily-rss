description: The majority of somatosensory DRG neurons express GABAA receptors (GABAAR)
  and depolarise in response to its activation based on the high intracellular chloride
  concentration maintained by the Na-K-Cl cotransporter type 1 (NKCC1). The translation
  of this response to peripheral nerve terminals in people is so far unclear. We show
  here that GABA (EC50 = 16.67μM) acting via GABAAR produces an influx of extracellular
  calcium in approximately 20% (336/1720) of isolated mouse DRG neurons. In ...
