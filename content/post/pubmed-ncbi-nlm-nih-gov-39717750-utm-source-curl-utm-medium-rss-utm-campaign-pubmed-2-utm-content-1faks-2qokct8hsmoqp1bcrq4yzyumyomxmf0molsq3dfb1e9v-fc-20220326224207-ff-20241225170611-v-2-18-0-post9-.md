description: 'CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated a pivotal role of the RAS-MAPK
  pathway in the NB cellular response to APR-246 via the modulation of intracellular
  concentrations of GSH and the transport of cystine through SLC7A11, phosphorylation
  of Hsp27, and programmed cell death. Combining APR-246 with RAS-MAPK pathway inhibitors
  can, in some cases, lead to antagonistic action, which can be reversed by combining
  APR-246 with the clinically approved drug ...'
