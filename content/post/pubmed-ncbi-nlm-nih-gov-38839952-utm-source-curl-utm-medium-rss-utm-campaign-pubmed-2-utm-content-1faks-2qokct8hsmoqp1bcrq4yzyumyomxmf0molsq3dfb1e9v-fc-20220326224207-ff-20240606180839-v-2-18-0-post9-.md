description: Histone acetylation regulates gene expression, cell function and cell
  fate¹. Here we study the pattern of histone acetylation in the epithelial tissue
  of the Drosophila wing disc. H3K18ac, H4K8ac and total lysine acetylation are increased
  in the outer rim of the disc. This acetylation pattern is controlled by nuclear
  position, whereby nuclei continuously move from apical to basal locations within
  the epithelium and exhibit high levels of H3K18ac when they are in proximity to
  the tissue ...
