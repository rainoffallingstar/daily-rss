description: In this paper we present a deep learning segmentation approach to classify
  and quantify the two most prevalent primary liver cancers - hepatocellular carcinoma
  and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma - from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole
  slide images. While semantic segmentation of medical images typically requires costly
  pixel-level annotations by domain experts, there often exists additional information
  which is routinely obtained in clinical diagnostics but rarely utilized for ...
