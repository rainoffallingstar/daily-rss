description: A substantial share of patients at risk of developing cardiovascular
  disease (CVD) fail to achieve control of CVD risk factors, but clinicians lack a
  structured approach to identify these patients. We applied machine learning to longitudinal
  data from two completed randomized controlled trials among 1502 individuals with
  diabetes in urban India and Pakistan. Using commonly available clinical data, we
  predict each individual's risk of failing to achieve CVD risk factor control goals
