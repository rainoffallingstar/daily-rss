description: Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are the most effective method for malaria
  prevention in Africa. Using near-infrared video tracking in a laboratory environment,
  we recorded and assessed bednet entry and exit by a northern Tanzanian population
  of Anopheles arabiensis at a human-occupied untreated net and a PermaNet® 2.0 ITN.
  Both had 12 holes, each 10 cm in diameter, punctured at specific locations, and
  the ITN was washed 20 times to further simulate the wear and tear of ageing. Washing
