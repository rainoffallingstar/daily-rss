description: The oncogenic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can drive tumorigenesis with disrupted
  host immunity, causing malignancies including post-transplant lymphoproliferative
  disorders (PTLDs). PTLD can also arise in the absence of EBV, but the biological
  differences underlying EBV(+) and EBV(-) B cell PTLD and the associated host-EBV-tumor
  interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we reveal the core differences between
  EBV(+) and EBV(-) PTLD, characterized by increased expression of genes related to
