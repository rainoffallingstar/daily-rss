description: The point spread function (PSF) of a microscope describes the image of
  a point emitter. Knowing the accurate PSF model is essential for various imaging
  tasks, including single-molecule localization, aberration correction and deconvolution.
  Here we present universal inverse modeling of point spread functions (uiPSF), a
  toolbox to infer accurate PSF models from microscopy data, using either image stacks
  of fluorescent beads or directly images of blinking fluorophores, the raw data ...
