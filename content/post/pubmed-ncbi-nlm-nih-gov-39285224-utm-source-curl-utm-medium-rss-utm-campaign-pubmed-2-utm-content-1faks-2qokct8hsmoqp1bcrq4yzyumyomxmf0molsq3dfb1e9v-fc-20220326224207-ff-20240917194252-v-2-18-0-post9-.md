  of diagnosis of cancer. In recent years, development of deep learning-based methods
  in computational pathology has enabled the prediction of biomarkers directly from
  WSIs. However, accurately linking tissue phenotype to biomarkers at scale remains
  a crucial challenge for democratizing complex biomarkers in precision oncology.
