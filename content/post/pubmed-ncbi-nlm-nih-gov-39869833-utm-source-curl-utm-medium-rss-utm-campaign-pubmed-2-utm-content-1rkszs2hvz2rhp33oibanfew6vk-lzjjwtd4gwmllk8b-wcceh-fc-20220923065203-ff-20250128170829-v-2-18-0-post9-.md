description: Most diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients treated with immunotherapies
  such as bispecific antibodies (BsAb) or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells
  fail to achieve durable treatment responses, underscoring the need for a deeper
  understanding of mechanisms that regulate the immune environment and response to
  treatment. Here, an integrative, multi-omic approach was applied to multiple large
  independent datasets in order to characterize DLBCL immune environments, and to
