CONCLUSION: This study underscores GPT-4o's potential to enhance patient education both before and after surgery by delivering accurate and relevant responses to FAQs about various surgical procedures. Responses regarding the postoperative course proved to be more accurate and less harmful than those addressing preoperative ones.
