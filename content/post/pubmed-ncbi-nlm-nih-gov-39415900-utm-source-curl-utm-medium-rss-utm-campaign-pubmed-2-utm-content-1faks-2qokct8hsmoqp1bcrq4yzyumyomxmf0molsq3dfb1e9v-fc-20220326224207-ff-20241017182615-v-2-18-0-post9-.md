title: A phase 1b/2 study evaluating efficacy and safety of MP0250, a designed ankyrin
  repeat protein (DARPin) simultaneously targeting vascular endothelial growth factor
  (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone,
  in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma

description: MP0250 is a designed ankyrin repeat protein that specifically inhibits
  both vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and hepatocyte growth factor
  (HGF), aiming at potentiating cancer therapy by disrupting the tumour microenvironment.
  Encouraging results from a phase 1 trial of MP0250 in patients with solid tumours
  prompted further investigation in multiple myeloma (MM) as both MP0250 targets are
  reported to be drivers of MM pathogenesis. In this open-label, single-arm phase
  1b/2 ...
