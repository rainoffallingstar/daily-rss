description: In mucosal barriers, tissue cells and leukocytes collaborate to form
  specialized niches that support host-microbiome symbiosis. Understanding the spatial
  organization of these barriers is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms underlying
  health and disease. The gingiva, a unique mucosal barrier with significant health
  implications, exhibits intricate tissue architecture and likely contains specialized
  immunological regions. Through spatial transcriptomic analysis, this study reveals
