description: Cardiotoxicity, particularly drug-induced arrhythmias, poses a significant
  challenge in drug development, highlighting the importance of early-stage prediction
  of human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) toxicity. hERG encodes the pore-forming
  subunit of the cardiac potassium channel. Traditional methods are both costly and
  time-intensive, necessitating the development of computational approaches. In this
