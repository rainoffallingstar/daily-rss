description: The presence of precursor to exhausted (T(pex)) CD8^(+) T cells is important
  to maintain robust immunity following treatment with immune checkpoint inhibition
  (ICI). Impressive responses to ICI are emerging in patients with stage II-III mismatch
  repair (MMR)-deficient (dMMR) colorectal cancer (CRC). We found 64% of dMMR and
  15% of mismatch repair-proficient (pMMR) stage III CRCs had a high frequency of
  tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL-hi). Furthermore, expression of TCF-1 (Tcf7)
  by CD8^(+) ...
