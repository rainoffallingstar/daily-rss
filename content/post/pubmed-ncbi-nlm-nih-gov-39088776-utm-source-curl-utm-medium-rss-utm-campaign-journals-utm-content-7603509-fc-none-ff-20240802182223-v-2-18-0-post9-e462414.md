description: Coagulation factor (F) VIII is essential for hemostasis. After activation,
  it combines with activated FIX (FIXa) on anionic membranes to form the intrinsic
  tenase enzyme complex, responsible for activating FX in the rate-limiting step of
  sustained coagulation. Hemophilia A and hemophilia B are due to inherited deficiencies
  in the activity of FVIII and FIX, respectively. Treatment of hemophilia A over the
  last decade has benefited from improved understanding of FVIII biology, including
