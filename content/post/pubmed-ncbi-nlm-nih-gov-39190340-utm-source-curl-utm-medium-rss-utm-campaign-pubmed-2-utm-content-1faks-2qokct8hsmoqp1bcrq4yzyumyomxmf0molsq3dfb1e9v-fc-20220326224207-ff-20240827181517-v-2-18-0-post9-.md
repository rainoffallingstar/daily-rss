description: The concept "nociplastic pain" has been developed for patients with features
  of nociceptive system sensitization that are not explained as nociceptive or neuropathic.
  Here, we tested how well the recently published grading system differentiates between
  chronic primary and secondary pain conditions. We recruited patients with fibromyalgia
  (FMS, n = 41), complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS, n = 11), osteoarthritis (OA,
  n = 21), or peripheral nerve injury (PNI, n = 8). We used clinical ...
