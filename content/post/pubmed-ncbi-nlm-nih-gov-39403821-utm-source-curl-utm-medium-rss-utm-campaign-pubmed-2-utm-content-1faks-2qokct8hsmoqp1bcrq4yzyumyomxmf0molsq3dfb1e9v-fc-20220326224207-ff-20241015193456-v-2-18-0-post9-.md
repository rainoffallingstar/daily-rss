description: Degenerative cerebellar ataxias comprise a heterogeneous group of rare
  and ultra-rare genetic diseases. While disease-modifying treatments are now on the
  horizon for many ataxias, robust trial designs and analysis methods are lacking.
  To better inform trial designs, we applied item response theory (IRT) modeling to
  evaluate the natural history progression of several ataxias, assessed with the widely
  used scale for assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA). A longitudinal IRT model
  was ...
