description: Non-invasive cardiac output monitoring, via electrical biosensing technology
  (EBT), provides continuous, multi-parameter hemodynamic variable monitoring which
  may allow for timely identification of hemodynamic instability in some neonates,
  providing an opportunity for early intervention that may improve neonatal outcomes.
  EBT encompasses thoracic (TEBT) and whole body (WBEBT) methods. Despite the lack
  of relative accuracy of these technologies, as compared to transthoracic echocardiography,
