  efficiency of sustainable industrial processes important to the global economy.
  However, stochasticity and genetic background effects often lead to suboptimal outcomes
  during laboratory evolution. Here we report an ALE platform to circumvent these
  shortcomings through parallelized clonal evolution at an unprecedented scale. Using
  this platform, we evolved 10⁴ yeast populations in parallel from many strains for
