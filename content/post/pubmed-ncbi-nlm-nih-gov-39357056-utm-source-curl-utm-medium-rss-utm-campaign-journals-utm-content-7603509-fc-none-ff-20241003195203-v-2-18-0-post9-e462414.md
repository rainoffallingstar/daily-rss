description: The BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax has shown promise for treating acute myeloid
  leukemia (AML). However, identifying patients likely to respond remains a challenge,
  especially for those with relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease. We evaluated the utility
  of ex vivo venetoclax sensitivity testing to predict treatment responses to venetoclax-azacitidine
  in a prospective, multicenter, phase 2 trial conducted by the Finnish AML Group
  (VenEx, NCT04267081). The trial recruited 104 participants with ...
