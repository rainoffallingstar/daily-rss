description: As we learn more about the multi-scale interstellar medium (ISM) of our
  Galaxy, we develop a greater understanding for the complex relationships between
  the large-scale diffuse gas and dust in Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs), how it moves,
  how it is affected by the nearby massive stars, and which portions of those GMCs
  eventually collapse into star forming regions. The complex interactions of those
  gas, dust and stellar populations form what has come to be known as the ecology
  of our ...
