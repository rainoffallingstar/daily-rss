description: Juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG) is a histiocytic neoplasm that usually
  presents in the skin. Rarely, extracutaneous localizations occur; the genetic drivers
  of this clinical variant of JXG remain incompletely characterized. We present detailed
  clinicopathologic and molecular data of 16 children with extracutaneous JXG and
  5 adults with xanthogranulomas confined to the central nervous system (CNS) or soft
  tissue. Tissue samples were obtained through the Dutch Nationwide Pathology Databank
