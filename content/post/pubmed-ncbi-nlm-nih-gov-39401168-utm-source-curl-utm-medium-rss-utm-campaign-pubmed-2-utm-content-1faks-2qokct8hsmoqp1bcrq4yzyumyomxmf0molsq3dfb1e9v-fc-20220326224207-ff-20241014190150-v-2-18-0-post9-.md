description: Shape-persistent Conjugated nanobelts are fascinating synthetic targets.
  However, in most cases these are made in low overall yields by applying strategies
  of macrocyclization followed by (multiple) ring fusion reactions for nanobelt formation.
  Here, we describe the high yielding synthesis of enantiopure chiral nanobelts in
  84% yield by applying chirality-assisted synthesis (CAS). The chiral nanobelts were
  investigated by UV/vis and CD spectroscopy. By DFT calculations the aromaticity
