description: Using the Bρ-defined isochronous mass spectrometry technique, we report
  the first determination of the ^{23}Si, ^{26}P, ^{27}S, and ^{31}Ar masses and improve
  the precision of the ^{28}S mass by a factor of 11. Our measurements confirm that
  these isotopes are bound and fix the location of the proton dripline in P, S, and
  Ar. We find that the mirror energy differences of the mirror-nuclei pairs ^{26}P-^{26}Na,
  ^{27}P-^{27}Mg, ^{27}S-^{27}Na, ^{28}S-^{28}Mg, and ^{31}Ar-^{31}Al ...
