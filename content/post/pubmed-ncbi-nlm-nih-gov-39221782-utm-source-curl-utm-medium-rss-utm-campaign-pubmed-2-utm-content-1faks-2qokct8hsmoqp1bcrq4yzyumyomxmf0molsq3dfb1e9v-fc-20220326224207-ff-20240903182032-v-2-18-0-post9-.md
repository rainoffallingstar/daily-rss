description: The initially homogeneous epithelium of the early Drosophila embryo differentiates
  into regional subpopulations with different behaviours and physical properties that
  are needed for morphogenesis. The factors at top of the genetic hierarchy that control
  these behaviours are known, but many of their targets are not. To understand how
  proteins work together to mediate differential cellular activities, we studied in
