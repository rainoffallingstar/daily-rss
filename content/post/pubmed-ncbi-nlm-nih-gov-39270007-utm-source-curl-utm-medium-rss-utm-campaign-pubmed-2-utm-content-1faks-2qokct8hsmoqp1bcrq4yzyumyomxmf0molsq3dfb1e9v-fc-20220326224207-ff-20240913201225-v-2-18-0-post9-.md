description: Cancers eventually kill hosts even when infiltrated by cancer-specific
  T cells. We examined whether cancer-specific T cell receptors of CD4^(+) T cells
  (CD4TCRs) from tumor-bearing hosts can be exploited for adoptive TCR therapy. We
  focused on CD4TCRs targeting an autochthonous mutant neoantigen that is only presented
  by stroma surrounding the MHC class II-negative cancer cells. The 11 most common
  tetramer-sorted CD4TCRs were tested using TCR-engineered CD4^(+) T cells. Three
