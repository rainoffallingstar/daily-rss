description: One of the most remarkable achievements of the TKI era has been the capacity
  to induce deep molecular remissions that are sustainable off therapy in chronic
  myeloid leukemia (CML) patients - treatment-free remission (TFR). TFR was first
  described in a handful of patients within 3-4 years of imatinib approval. In 2004
  TFR was tested in a small French pilot study, followed soon after by the French
  STIM and Australasian TWISTER studies. These early trials demonstrated that TFR
