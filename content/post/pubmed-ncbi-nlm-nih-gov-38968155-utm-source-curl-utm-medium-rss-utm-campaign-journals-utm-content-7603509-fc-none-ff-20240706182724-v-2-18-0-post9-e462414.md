description: Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a multimeric protein consisting of covalently
  linked monomers, which share an identical domain architecture. Although involved
  in processes like inflammation, angiogenesis and cancer metastasis, VWF is mostly
  known for its role in hemostasis, by acting as a chaperone-protein for coagulation
  factor VIII (FVIII) and by contributing to the recruitment of platelets during thrombus
  formation. To serve its role in hemostasis, VWF needs to bind a variety of ...
