description: By acquiring or evolving resistance to one antibiotic, bacteria can become
  cross-resistant to a second antibiotic, which further limits therapeutic choices.
  In the opposite scenario, initial resistance leads to collateral sensitivity to
  a second antibiotic, which can inform cycling or combinatorial treatments. Despite
  their clinical relevance, our knowledge of both interactions is limited. We used
  published chemical genetics data of the Escherichia coli single-gene deletion library
