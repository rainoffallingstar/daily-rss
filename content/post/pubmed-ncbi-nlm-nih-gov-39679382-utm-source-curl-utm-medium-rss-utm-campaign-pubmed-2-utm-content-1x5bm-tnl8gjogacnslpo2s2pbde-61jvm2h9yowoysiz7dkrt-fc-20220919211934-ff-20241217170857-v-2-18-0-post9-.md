description: Spatial transcriptomics has transformed genomic research by measuring
  spatially resolved gene expressions, allowing us to investigate how cells adapt
  to their microenvironment via modulating their expressed genes. This essential process
  usually starts from cell-cell communication (CCC) via ligand-receptor (LR) interaction,
  leading to regulatory changes within the receiver cell. However, few methods were
  developed to connect them to provide biological insights into intercellular regulation.
