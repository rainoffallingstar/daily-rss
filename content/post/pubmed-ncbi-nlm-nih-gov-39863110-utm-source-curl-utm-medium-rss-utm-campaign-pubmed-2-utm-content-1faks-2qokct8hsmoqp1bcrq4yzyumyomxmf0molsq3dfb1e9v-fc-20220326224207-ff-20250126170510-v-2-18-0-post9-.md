description: Fibro-osseous tumors of the craniofacial bones are a heterogeneous group
  of lesions comprising cemento-osseous dysplasia (COD), cemento-ossifying fibroma
  (COF), juvenile trabecular ossifying fibroma (JTOF), psammomatoid ossifying fibroma
  (PsOF), fibrous dysplasia (FD), and low-grade osteosarcoma (LGOS) with overlapping
  clinicopathological features. However, their clinical behavior and treatment differ
  significantly, underlining the need for accurate diagnosis. Molecular diagnostic
