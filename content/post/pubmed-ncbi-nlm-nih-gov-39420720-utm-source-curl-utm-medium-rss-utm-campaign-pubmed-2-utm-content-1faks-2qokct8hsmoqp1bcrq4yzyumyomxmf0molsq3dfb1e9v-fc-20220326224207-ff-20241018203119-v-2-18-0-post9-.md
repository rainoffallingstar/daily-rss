description: Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated immunogenic cell death (ICD) is
  crucial in radioimmunotherapy by boosting innate antitumor immunity. However, the
  hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME) often impedes ROS production, limiting the
  efficacy of radiotherapy. To tackle this challenge, a combination therapy involving
  radiotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with anti-programmed death-ligand
  1 (PD-L1) has been explored to enhance antitumor effects and reprogram the immunosuppressive
