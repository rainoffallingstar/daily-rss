description: Expansion microscopy has recently emerged as an alternative technique
  for achieving high-resolution imaging of biological structures. Improvements in
  resolution are achieved by physically expanding samples through embedding in a swellable
  hydrogel before microscopy. However, expansion microscopy has been rarely used in
  the field of virology. Here, we evaluate and characterize the ultrastructure expansion
  microscopy (U-ExM) protocol, which facilitates approximately four-fold sample ...
