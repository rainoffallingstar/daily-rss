description: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy represents a transformative
  advancement in treating relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM) in both early-
  and late-line settings. MM, a plasma cell malignancy, traditionally requires ongoing
  complex drug regimens, posing significant burdens on patients. In contrast, CAR
  T-cell therapy offers a one-time treatment option without the need for continuous
  maintenance therapy. CAR T-cell therapy leverages engineered T-cells to target ...
