description: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) comprises two clinically relevant
  molecular subtypes that are currently determined using tissue biopsies, which are
  spatially biased and highly invasive. We used whole transcriptome sequencing of
  10 plasma samples with tumor-informed subtypes, complemented by proteomic analysis
  for minimally invasive identification of PDAC subtype markers. Data were validated
  in independent large cohorts and correlated with treatment response and patient
