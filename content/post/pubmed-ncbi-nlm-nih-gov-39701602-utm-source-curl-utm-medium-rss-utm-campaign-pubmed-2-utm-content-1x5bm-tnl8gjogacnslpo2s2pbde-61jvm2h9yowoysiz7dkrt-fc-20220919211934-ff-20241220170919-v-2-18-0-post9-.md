description: The rapid advancement of spatial transcriptomics (ST) sequencing technology
  has made it possible to capture gene expression with spatial coordinate information
  at the cellular level. Although many methods in ST data analysis can detect spatially
  variable genes (SVGs), these methods often fail to identify genes with explicit
  spatial expression patterns due to the lack of consideration for spatial domains.
  Considering spatial domains is crucial for identifying SVGs as it focuses the analysis
