description: Super-resolution microscopy has been used to show the formation of receptor
  clusters and adapted lipid organization of cell membranes for many members of the
  ErbB receptor family. The clustering behaviour depends on the receptor size and
  shape, possibly ligand binding or expression activity. Using single molecule localization
  microscopy (SMLM), we also showed this typical clustering for the epidermal growth
  factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells. ...
