description: T-cell recruiting chemokines are required for a successful immune intervention
  in ovarian cancer, and also for the efficacy of modern anticancer agents such as
  PARP inhibitors. The chemokine CX3CL1 recruits tumour-suppressive T-cells into solid
  tumours, but also mediates cell-cell adhesions, e.g. of tumour cells, through its
  membrane-bound form. So far, its role in ovarian cancer has only been rudimentarily
  addressed. We show that high CX3CL1 expression significantly correlates with ...
