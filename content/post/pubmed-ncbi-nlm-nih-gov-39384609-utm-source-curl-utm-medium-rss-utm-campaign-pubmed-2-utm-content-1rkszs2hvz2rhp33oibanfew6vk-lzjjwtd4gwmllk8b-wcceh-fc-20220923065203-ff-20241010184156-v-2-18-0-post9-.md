description: MGTA-145 or GROβT, a CXCR2 agonist, has shown promising activity for
  hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) mobilization with plerixafor in pre-clinical studies
  and healthy volunteers. Twenty-five patients with multiple myeloma enrolled in a
  phase 2 trial evaluating MGTA-145 and plerixafor for HSC mobilization (NCT04552743).
  Plerixafor was given subcutaneously followed 2 h later by MGTA-145 (0.03 mg/kg)
  intravenously with same day apheresis. Mobilization/apheresis could be repeated
  for a second day ...
