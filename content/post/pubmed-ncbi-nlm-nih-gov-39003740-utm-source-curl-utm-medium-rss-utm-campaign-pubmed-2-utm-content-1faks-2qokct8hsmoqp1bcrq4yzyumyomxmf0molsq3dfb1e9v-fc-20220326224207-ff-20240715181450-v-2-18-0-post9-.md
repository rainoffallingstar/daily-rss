description: Noonan syndrome patients harboring causative variants in LZTR1 are particularly
  at risk to develop severe and early-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In this study,
  we investigate the mechanistic consequences of a homozygous variant LZTR1^(L580P)
  by using patient-specific and CRISPR-Cas9-corrected induced pluripotent stem cell
  (iPSC) cardiomyocytes. Molecular, cellular, and functional phenotyping in combination
  with in silico prediction identify an LZTR1^(L580P)-specific disease ...
