description: Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) is a heterogeneous
  group of malignancies with poor outcome. Here, we identify a subgroup, PTCL-NOS^(SMARCB1-),
  which is characterized by the lack of the SMARCB1 protein and occurs more frequently
  in young patients. Human and murine PTCL-NOS^(SMARCB1-) show similar DNA methylation
  profiles, with hypermethylation of T-cell-related genes and hypomethylation of genes
  involved in myeloid development. Single-cell analyses of human ...
