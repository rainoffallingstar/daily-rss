description: Stronger chemical bonds withstand higher mechanical forces; thus, the
  rupture of single bonds is preferred over the rupture of double or triple bonds
  or aromatic rings. We investigated bond scission in poly(dialkyl-p-phenylene ethynylene)s
  (PPEs), a fully conjugated polymer. In a scale-bridging approach using electron-paramagnetic
  resonance spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography of cryomilled samples,
  in combination with density functional theory calculations and ...
