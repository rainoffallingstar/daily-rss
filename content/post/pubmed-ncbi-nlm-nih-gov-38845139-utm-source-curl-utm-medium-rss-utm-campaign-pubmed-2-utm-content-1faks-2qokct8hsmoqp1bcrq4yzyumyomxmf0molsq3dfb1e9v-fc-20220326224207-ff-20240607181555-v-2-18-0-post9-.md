description: 'Purpose: The aim of this matched-pair cohort study was to evaluate the
  potential of intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for sparring of the pelvic
  bone marrow and thus reduction of hematotoxicity compared to intensity-modulated
  photon radiotherapy (IMRT) in the setting of postoperative irradiation of gynaecological
  malignancies. Secondary endpoint was the assessment of predictive parameters for
  the occurrence of sacral insufficiency fractures (SIF) when applying IMPT. Materials
