description: 'The borosilicate 0106-B1-bioactive glass (BG) composition (in wt%: 37.5
  SiO(2), 22.6 CaO, 5.9 Na(2)O, 4.0P(2)O(5), 12.0 K(2)O, 5.5 MgO, 12.5 B(2)O(3)) has
  shown favorable processing characteristics and bone regeneration ability. This study
  investigated the addition of zinc (Zn) to 0106-B1-BG as an approach to improve this
  BG''s biological properties. Different proportions of ZnO were substituted for CaO
  in 0106-B1-BG, resulting in three new BG-compositions: 1-Zn-BG, 2-Zn-BG, 3-Zn-BG
