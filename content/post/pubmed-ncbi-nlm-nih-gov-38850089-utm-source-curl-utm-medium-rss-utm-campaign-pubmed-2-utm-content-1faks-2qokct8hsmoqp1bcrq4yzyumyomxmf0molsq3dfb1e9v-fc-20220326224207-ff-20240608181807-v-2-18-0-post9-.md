description: 'CONCLUSION: We developed and externally validated a HNC risk prediction
  model using the ARCAGE and UK Biobank studies, respectively. This model had moderate
  performance in the development population and acceptable performance in the validation
  dataset. Demographics and risk behaviors are strong predictors of HNC, and this
  model may be a helpful tool in primary dental care settings to promote prevention
  and determine recall intervals for dental examination. Future addition of HPV serology
