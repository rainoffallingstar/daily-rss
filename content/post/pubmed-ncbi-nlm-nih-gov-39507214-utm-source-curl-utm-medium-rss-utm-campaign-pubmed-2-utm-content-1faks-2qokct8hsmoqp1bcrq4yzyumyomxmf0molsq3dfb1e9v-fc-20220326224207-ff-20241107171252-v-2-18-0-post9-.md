description: Unblinded interim analyses in clinical trials with adaptive designs are
  gaining increasing popularity. Here, the type I error rate is controlled by defining
  an appropriate conditional error function. Since various approaches to the selection
  of the conditional error function exist, the question of an optimal choice arises.
  In this article, we extend existing work on optimal conditional error functions
  by two results. Firstly, we prove that techniques from variational calculus can
  be applied ...
