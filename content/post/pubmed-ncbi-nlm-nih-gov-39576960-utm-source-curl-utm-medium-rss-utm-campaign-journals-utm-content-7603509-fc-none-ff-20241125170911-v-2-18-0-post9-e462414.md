description: Myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MYD88) is a key
  adaptor molecule in the signaling pathways of toll-like receptor (TLR) and interleukin-1
  receptor (IL-1R). A somatic mutation resulting in a leucine-to-proline change at
  position 265 of the MYD88 protein (MYD88 L265P) is one of the most prevalent oncogenic
  mutations found in patients with hematological malignancies. In this study, we employed
  high-throughput screening to identify lasalocid-A as a potent small molecule ...
