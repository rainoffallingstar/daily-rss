description: Dengue fever represents a significant medical and socio-economic burden
  in (sub)tropical regions, yet antivirals for treatment or prophylaxis are lacking.
  JNJ-A07 was described as highly active against the different genotypes within each
  serotype of the disease-causing dengue virus (DENV). Based on clustering of resistance
  mutations it has been assumed to target DENV non-structural protein 4B (NS4B). Using
