description: Osteosarcoma is the most common form of primary bone cancer, which primarily
  afflicts children and adolescents. Chemotherapy, consisting of doxorubicin, cisplatin
  and methotrexate (MAP) increased the 5-year osteosarcoma survival rate from 20%
  to approximately 60% by the 1980s. However, osteosarcoma survival rates have remained
  stagnant for several decades. Patients whose disease fails to respond to MAP receive
  second-line treatments such as etoposide and, in more recent years, the ...
