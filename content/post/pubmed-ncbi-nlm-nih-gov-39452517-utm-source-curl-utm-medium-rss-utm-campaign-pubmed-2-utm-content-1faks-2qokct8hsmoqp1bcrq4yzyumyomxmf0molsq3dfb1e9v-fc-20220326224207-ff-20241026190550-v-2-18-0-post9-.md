description: Figural matrices tests are frequently used to measure fluid intelligence.
  The HeiQ-an operation-oriented figural matrices test-was developed to tackle limitations
  of previous matrices tests, mainly the possibility of excluding distractors based
  on superficial features instead of actively solving the items. However, allowing
  for a total administration time of 60 min for the assessment of one construct is
  not feasible in many study designs. Thus, the goal of this study was to develop
