description: Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) has been increasingly used in the
  treatment of severe infarct-related cardiogenic shock in the last decade. The randomised
  ECLS-SHOCK trial demonstrated no benefit of early routine use on 30-day all-cause
  death. We herein present mid-term results. At 1-year follow-up, there were no significant
  differences in all-cause or cardiovascular mortality, neurologic outcome, recurrent
  myocardial infarction, repeat revascularisation and rehospitalisations for ...
