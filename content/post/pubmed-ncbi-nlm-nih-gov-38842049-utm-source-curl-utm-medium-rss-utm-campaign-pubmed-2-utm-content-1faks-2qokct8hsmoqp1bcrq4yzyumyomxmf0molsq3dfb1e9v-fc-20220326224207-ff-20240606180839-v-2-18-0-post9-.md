description: To improve our understanding of the interaction mechanism in trivalent
  lanthanide and actinide complexes, studies with structurally different hard and
  soft donor ligands are of great interest. For that reason, the coordination chemistry
  of An(III) and Ln(III) with 2,6-bis(5-(tert-butyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)pyridine (C4-BPP)
  has been explored. Time-resolved laser fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLFS) studies
  have revealed the formation of [Cm(C4-BPP)(n)]^(3+) (n = 1-3) (log β(1)' = 7.2 ±
  0.4, log β(2)' ...
