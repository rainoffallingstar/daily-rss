description: Synergistic interactions between human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) and Epstein-Barr
  virus (EBV) are hypothesized in the etiopathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS).
  This study investigated if HHV-6A and EBV seroreactivities interact regarding the
  risk of developing MS. Antibodies against viral antigens were analyzed in biobank
  samples from 670 individuals who later developed MS and matched controls. Additive
  interactions were analyzed. A significant interaction between HHV-6A and ...
