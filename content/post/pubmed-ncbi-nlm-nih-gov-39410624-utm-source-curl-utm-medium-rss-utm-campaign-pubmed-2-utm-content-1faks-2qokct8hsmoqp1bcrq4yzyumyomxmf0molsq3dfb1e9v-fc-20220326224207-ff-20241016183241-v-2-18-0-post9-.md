description: 'Objectives: This study aims to investigate MRI features predicting the
  grade of STS malignancy using conventional image reading and radiomics. Methods:
  Pretherapeutic imaging data regarding size, tissue heterogeneity, peritumoral changes,
  necrosis, hemorrhage, and cystic degeneration were evaluated in conventional image
  reading. Furthermore, the tumors'' apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and
  radiomics features were extracted and analyzed. A random forest machine learning
