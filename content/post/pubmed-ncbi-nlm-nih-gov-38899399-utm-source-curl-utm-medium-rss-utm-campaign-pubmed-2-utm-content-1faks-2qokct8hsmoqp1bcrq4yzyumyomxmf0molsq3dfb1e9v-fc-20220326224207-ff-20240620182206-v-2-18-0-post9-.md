description: Pathogenic Eurasian hantaviruses cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome
  (HFRS), which is characterized by acute kidney injury. The clinical course shows
  a broad range of severity and is influenced by direct and immune-mediated effects.
  The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a marker of systemic inflammation and
  predicts severity and outcome in various diseases. Therefore, we examined the role
  of NLR in HFRS caused by hantavirus Puumala (PUUV) and its association with disease
