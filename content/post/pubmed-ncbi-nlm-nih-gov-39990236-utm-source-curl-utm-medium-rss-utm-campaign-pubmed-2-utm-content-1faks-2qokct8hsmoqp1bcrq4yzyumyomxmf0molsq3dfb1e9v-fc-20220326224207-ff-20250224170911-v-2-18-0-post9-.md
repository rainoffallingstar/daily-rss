description: Within the established framework of structure formation, galaxies start
  as systems of low stellar mass and gradually grow into far more massive galaxies.
  The existence of massive galaxies in the first billion years of the Universe, as
  suggested by recent observations, seems to challenge this model, as such galaxies
  would require highly efficient conversion of baryons into stars. An even greater
  challenge in this epoch is the existence of massive galaxies that have already ceased
  forming ...
