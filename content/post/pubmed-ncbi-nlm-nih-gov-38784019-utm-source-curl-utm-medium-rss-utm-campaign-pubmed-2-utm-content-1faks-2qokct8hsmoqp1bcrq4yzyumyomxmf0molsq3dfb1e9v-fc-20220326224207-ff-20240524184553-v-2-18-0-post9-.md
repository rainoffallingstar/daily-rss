description: Cells' structure is key to understanding cellular function, diagnostics,
  and therapy development. Soft X-ray tomography (SXT) is a unique tool to image cellular
  structure without fixation or labeling at high spatial resolution and throughput.
  Fast acquisition times increase demand for accelerated image analysis, like segmentation.
  Currently, segmenting cellular structures is done manually and is a major bottleneck
  in the SXT data analysis. This paper introduces ACSeg, an automated 3D ...
