description: Filamentous viruses like influenza and torovirus often display systematic
  bends and arcs of mysterious physical origin. We propose that such viruses undergo
  an instability from a cylindrically symmetric to a toroidally curved state. This
  "toro-elastic" state emerges via spontaneous symmetry breaking under prestress due
  to short range spike protein interactions magnified by surface topography. Once
  surface stresses are sufficiently large, the filament buckles and the curved state
