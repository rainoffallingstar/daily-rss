description: BCMA-targeted CAR T-cells transformed the treatment of relapsed and refractory
  multiple myeloma (RRMM), yet improvements are needed in manufacturing, toxicity
  and efficacy. We conducted a phase 1 clinical trial of BMS-986354, an autologous
  BCMA CAR T manufactured using an optimized NEX-T® process, in participants with
  triple-class exposed, RRMM. The 65 participants had a median of 5 (range 3-13) prior
  regimens, 39% had cytogenetic high-risk, 91% triple-class refractory, and 43% ...
