description: Despite advances in treatments, multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable
  cancer where relapse is common. We developed a circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) approach
  in order to characterize tumor genomics, monitor treatment response, and detect
  early relapse in MM. By sequencing 412 specimens from 64 patients with newly diagnosed
  or relapsed/refractory disease, we demonstrate the correlation between ctDNA and
  key clinical biomarkers, as well as patient outcomes. We further extend our approach
