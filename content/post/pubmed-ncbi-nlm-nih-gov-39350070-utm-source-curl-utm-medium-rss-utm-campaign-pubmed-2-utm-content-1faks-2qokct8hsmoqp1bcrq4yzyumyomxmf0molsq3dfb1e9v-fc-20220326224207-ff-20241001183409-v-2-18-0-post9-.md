description: 'CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to unveil the
  direct targeting of DCN by oncomiR-181a. We also highlighted that miR-181a affects
  targets related to cellular proliferation in HCC which may be partly mediated through
  inhibition of DCN transcription. Thus, miR-181a could be a promising biomarker for
  the early detection and monitoring of liver cancer progression. This would pave
  the way for the future targeting of the oncomiR-181a as a therapeutic approach in
  liver ...'
