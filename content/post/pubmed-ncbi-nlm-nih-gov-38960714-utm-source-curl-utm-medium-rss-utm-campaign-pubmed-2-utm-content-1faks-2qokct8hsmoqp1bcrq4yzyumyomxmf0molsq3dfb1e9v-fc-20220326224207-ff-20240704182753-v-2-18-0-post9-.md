description: Despite their unique histologic features, gliosarcomas belong to the
  group of glioblastomas and are treated according to the same standards. Fibroblast
  activation protein (FAP) is a component of a tumor-specific subpopulation of fibroblasts
  that plays a critical role in tumor growth and invasion. Some case studies suggest
  an elevated expression of FAP in glioblastoma and a particularly strong expression
  in gliosarcoma attributed to traits of predominant mesenchymal differentiation.
