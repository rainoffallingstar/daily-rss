description: Free molecules undergo processes with photons; in particular, they can
  undergo photoionization and photodissociation, which are relevant processes in nature
  and laboratory. Recently, it has been shown that in a cavity, the reverse process
  of photoionization, namely, electron capture becomes highly probable. The underlying
  mechanism is the formation of a hybrid resonance state. In this work, we demonstrate
  that the idea of enhanced reverse processes is more general. We discuss the case
