description: The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in mammals and the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal
  (HPI) axis in fish are open systems that adapt to the environment during development.
  Little is known about how this adaptation begins and regulates early stress responses.
  We used larval zebrafish to examine the impact of prolonged forced swimming at 5
  days post-fertilization (dpf), termed early-life challenge (ELC), on cortisol responses,
  neuropeptide expression in the nucleus preopticus ...
