description: The viral NS2B-NS3 protease is a promising drug target to combat dengue
  virus (DENV) and other emerging flaviviruses. The discovery of novel DENV protease
  inhibitors with antiviral efficacy is hampered by the low predictive power of biochemical
  assays. We herein present a comparative evaluation of biochemical DENV protease
  assay conditions and their benchmarking against antiviral efficacy and a protease-specific
  reporter gene assay. Variations were performed with respect to pH, type ...
