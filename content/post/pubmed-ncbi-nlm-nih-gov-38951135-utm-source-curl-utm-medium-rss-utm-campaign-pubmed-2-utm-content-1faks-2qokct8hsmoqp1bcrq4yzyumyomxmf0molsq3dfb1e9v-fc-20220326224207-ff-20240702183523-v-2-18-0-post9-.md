description: The formation of planets in our solar system encompassed various stages
  of accretion of planetesimals that formed in the protoplanetary disk within the
  first few million years at different distances to the sun. Their chemical diversity
  is reflected by compositionally variable meteorite groups from different parent
  bodies. There is general consensus that their formation location is roughly constrained
  by a dichotomy of nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies, relating carbonaceous (C) meteorite
