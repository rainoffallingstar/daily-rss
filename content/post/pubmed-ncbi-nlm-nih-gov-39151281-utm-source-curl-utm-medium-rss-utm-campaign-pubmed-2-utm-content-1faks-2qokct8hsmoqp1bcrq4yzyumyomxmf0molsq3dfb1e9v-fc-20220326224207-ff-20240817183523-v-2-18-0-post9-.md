description: Up to 40% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) develop
  central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Current treatments for this subgroup of
  patients with advanced NSCLC include local therapies (surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery,
  and, less frequently, whole-brain radiotherapy), targeted therapies for oncogene-addicted
  NSCLC (small molecules, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and antibody-drug conjugates),
  and immune checkpoint inhibitors (as monotherapy or combination therapy), ...
