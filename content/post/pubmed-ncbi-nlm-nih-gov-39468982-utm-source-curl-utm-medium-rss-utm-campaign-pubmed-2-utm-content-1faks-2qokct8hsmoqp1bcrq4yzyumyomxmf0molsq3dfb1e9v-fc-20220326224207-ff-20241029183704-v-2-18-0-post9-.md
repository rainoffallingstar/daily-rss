description: DZH2, a dual inhibitor of the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4, was
  discovered from virtual screening for CCR5 antagonists. In specific Ca^(2+) chemokine
  signaling assays, DZH2 displayed low micromolar IC(50) values at both chemokine
  receptors. Its binding to intracellular allosteric binding sites of CCR5 and CXCR4
  was confirmed by MD simulations and binding free-energy calculations. DZH2 is superior
  to the CCR5 antagonist maraviroc in terms of its inhibitory activity on the growth
  of ...
