description: In this study, we optimized the dissociation of synovial tissue biopsies
  for single-cell omics studies and created a single-cell atlas of human synovium
  in inflammatory arthritis. The optimized protocol allowed consistent isolation of
  highly viable cells from tiny fresh synovial biopsies, minimizing the synovial biopsy
  drop-out rate. The synovium scRNA-seq atlas contained over 100,000 unsorted synovial
  cells from 25 synovial tissues affected by inflammatory arthritis, including 16
