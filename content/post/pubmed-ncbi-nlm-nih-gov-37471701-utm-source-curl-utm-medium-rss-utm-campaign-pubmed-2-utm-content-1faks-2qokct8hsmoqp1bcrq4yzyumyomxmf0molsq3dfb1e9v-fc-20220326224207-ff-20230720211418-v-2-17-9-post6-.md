description: A simple and highly efficient strategy has been developed for direct
  C-H trifluoromethylation at C-3 of imidazopyridines and C-8 of quinoxalines with
  readily available Langlois reagent through KMnO(4)/AcOH system. This protocol showed
  broad substrate scope and afforded moderate-to-excellent yields of both products.
  It is the first report that the functionalization of quinoxalines occurred regioselectively
  at the C-8 position of quinoxalines. Mechanistic studies revealed that reaction
