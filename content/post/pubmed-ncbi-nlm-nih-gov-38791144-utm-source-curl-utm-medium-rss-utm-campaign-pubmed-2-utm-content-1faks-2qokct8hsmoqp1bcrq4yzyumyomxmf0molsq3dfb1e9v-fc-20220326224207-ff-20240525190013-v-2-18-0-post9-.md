description: Cellular myxoma is a benign soft tissue tumor frequently associated with
  GNAS mutation that may morphologically resemble low-grade myxofibrosarcoma. This
  study aimed to identify the undescribed methylation profile of cellular myxoma and
  compare it to myxofibrosarcoma. We performed molecular analysis on twenty cellular
  myxomas and nine myxofibrosarcomas and analyzed the results using the methylation-based
  DKFZ sarcoma classifier. A total of 90% of the cellular myxomas had GNAS mutations
