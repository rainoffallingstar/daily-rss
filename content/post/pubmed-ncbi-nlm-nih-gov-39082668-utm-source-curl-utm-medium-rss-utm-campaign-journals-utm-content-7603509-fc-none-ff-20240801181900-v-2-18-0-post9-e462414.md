description: Venetoclax-obinutuzumab (Ven-Obi) is a standard-of-care for patients
  with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In the CLL14 study,
  patients with previously untreated CLL and coexisting conditions were randomized
  to 12 cycles of Ven-Obi (n=216) or chlorambucil-obinutuzumab (Clb-Obi, n=216). Progression-free
  survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. Key secondary endpoints included time-to-next-treatment
  (TTNT), rates of undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD), ...
