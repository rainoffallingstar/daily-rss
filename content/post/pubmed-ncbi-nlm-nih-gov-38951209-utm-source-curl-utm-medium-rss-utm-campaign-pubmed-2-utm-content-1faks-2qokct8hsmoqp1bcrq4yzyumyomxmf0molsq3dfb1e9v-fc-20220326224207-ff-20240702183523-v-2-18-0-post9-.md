description: The placement of a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt is a common neurosurgical,
  pediatric procedure with various, well-documented complications occurring both in
  the immediate postoperative course of the procedure and at later stages. Pediatric
  patients need frequent revision surgeries due to body growth as well as implant
  failure over the course of the years. We report a rare case of a 12-year-old patient,
  presenting with torticollis, 11 years after the initial placement of a VP shunt.
