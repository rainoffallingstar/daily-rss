description: Colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumors
  are mostly treated with chemotherapy. Clinical benefits of targeted therapies depend
  on mutational states and tumor location. Many tumors carry mutations in KRAS proto-oncogene,
  GTPase (KRAS) or B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF), rendering
  them more resistant to therapies. We performed whole-exome sequencing and RNA-Sequencing
  of 28 tumors of the Athens Comprehensive Cancer Center CRC cohort, ...
