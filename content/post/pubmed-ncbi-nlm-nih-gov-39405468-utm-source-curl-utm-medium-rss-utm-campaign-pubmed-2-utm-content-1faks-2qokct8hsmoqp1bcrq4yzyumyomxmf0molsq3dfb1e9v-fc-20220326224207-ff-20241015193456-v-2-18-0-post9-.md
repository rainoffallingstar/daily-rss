description: The addition of dispersion corrections to density functionals is essential
  for accurate energy and geometry predictions. Among them, the D4 scheme is popular
  due to its low computational cost and high accuracy. However, due to its design,
  the D4 correction can occasionally lead to anomalies, such as unphysical curvature
  and bumps in the potential energy surface. We find these anomalies are common in
  the D4 model, although observable consequences are rarer than in the D3 model for
