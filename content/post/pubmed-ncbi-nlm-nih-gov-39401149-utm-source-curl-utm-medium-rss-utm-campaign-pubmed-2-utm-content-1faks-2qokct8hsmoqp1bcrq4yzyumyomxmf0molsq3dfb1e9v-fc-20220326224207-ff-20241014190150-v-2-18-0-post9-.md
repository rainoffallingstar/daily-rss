description: Increased circulating histones correlate with sepsis severity and are
  a potential therapeutic target. Pre-clinical studies showed benefit with a histone-neutralizing
  polyanion molecule (STC3141). We aimed to investigate the safety, tolerability,
  and pharmacokinetics of STC3141 in critically ill patients with sepsis. We studied
  26 patients with sepsis divided into four cohorts of one, five, ten, and ten subjects,
  respectively. We conducted a dose-adjusted, open-label study to determine ...
