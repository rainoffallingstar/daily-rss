description: Cancer progression is orchestrated by the accrual of mutations in driver
  genes, which endow malignant cells with a selective proliferative advantage. Identifying
  cancer driver genes is crucial for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of cancer,
  advancing targeted therapies, and uncovering novel biomarkers. Based on integrated
  analysis of Multi-Omics data and Network models, we present MONet, a novel cancer
  driver gene identification algorithm. Our method utilizes two graph neural ...
