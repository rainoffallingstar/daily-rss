  failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Exposure to high-fat diet and
  nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N[w]-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) recapitulate
  features of HFpEF in mice. To identify disease-specific traits during adverse remodeling,
  we profiled interstitial cells in early murine HFpEF using single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq).
