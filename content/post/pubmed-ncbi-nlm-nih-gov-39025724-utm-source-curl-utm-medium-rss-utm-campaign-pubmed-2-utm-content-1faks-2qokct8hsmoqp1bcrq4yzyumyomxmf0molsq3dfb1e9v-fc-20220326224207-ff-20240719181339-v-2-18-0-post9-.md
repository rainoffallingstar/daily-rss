description: Measurable residual disease (MRD) testing is an essential aspect of disease
  prognostication in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and informs clinical decisions.
  The depth of MRD clearance is highly relevant and requires assays with sufficient
  sensitivity. Austin Pathology is one of the few laboratories in Australia currently
  utilising a fully validated and National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA)-accredited
  ultrasensitive next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform for MRD ...
