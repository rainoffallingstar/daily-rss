description: Coregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) and cancer stem cells (CSCs) is very
  important in carcinogenesis. miR-127-5p is known to be downregulated in breast cancer.
  In this study, we aimed to investigate how boric acid (BA), known for its previously
  unstudied anti-cancer properties, would affect the expression of miR127-5p and genes
  responsible for breast cancer stem cells (BC-SCs) metastasis. BC-SCs were isolated
  from human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) by immunomagnetic cell separation ...
