description: Both the transfrontal and the suboccipital-transcerebellar approach are
  frequently used trajectories for frame-based stereotactic biopsies of brainstem
  lesions. Nevertheless, it remains unclear which approach is more favorable in terms
  of complications, diagnostic success and outcome, especially considering the location
  of the lesion within the brainstem. This study compared the safety and diagnostic
  yield of these two approaches. Furthermore, a brainstem zone model was created to
