description: Cancers during oncogenic progression hold information in epigenetic memory
  which allows flexible encoding of malignant phenotypes and more rapid reaction to
  the environment when compared to purely mutation-based clonal evolution mechanisms.
  Cancer memory describes a proposed mechanism by which complex information such as
  metastasis phenotypes, therapy resistance and interaction patterns with the tumor
  environment might be encoded at multiple levels via mechanisms used in memory formation
