description: In animals, adaptive transcription is a crucial mechanism to connect
  environmental stimulation to changes in gene expression and subsequent organism
  remodeling. Adaptive transcriptional programs involving molecules such as CREB,
  SRF, MEF2, FOS, and EGR1 are central to a wide variety of organism functions, including
  learning and memory, immune system plasticity, and muscle hypertrophy, and their
  activation increases cellular resilience and prevents various diseases. Yet, they
  also form the ...
