description: AdoMet (S-adenosylmethionine) inhibits cancer cell proliferation and
  migration via epigenetic alterations. This study aimed to investigate whether AdoMet
  may cause alterations in microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles that are important
  for the initiation and progression of prostate cancer. PC-3 cells were treated with
  AdoMet before miRNA sequencing. A total of 17 differentially expressed miRNAs were
  detected. Target gene prediction was performed by means of databases. Results were
  aligned ...
