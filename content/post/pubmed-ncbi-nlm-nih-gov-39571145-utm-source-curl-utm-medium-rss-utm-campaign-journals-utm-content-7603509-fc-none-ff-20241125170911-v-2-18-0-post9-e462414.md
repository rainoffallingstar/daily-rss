description: CD70 has emerged as a promising target in acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
  and we have previously demonstrated the potency of an optimized CD70-targeted ligand-based
  CAR. However, here, we identify in vivo CD70 antigen escape as a limitation of single
  antigen targeting. Combination targeting of CD70 and CD33 may overcome AML antigen
  heterogeneity. We hypothesized that modifying our CD70 CAR platform to secrete a
  bispecific T cell engaging antibody molecule ("TEAM") targeting CD33 (7033) ...
