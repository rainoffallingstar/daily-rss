description: Purpose Freehand sonographic percutaneous puncture techniques for the
  renal calyceal system are on the rise. Much time and practice are required to master
  this technique. Navigation-supported puncture aids could help make percutaneous
  access easier and faster. The aim of this study was to determine whether navigated
  puncture is feasible, and whether it is easier and faster compared to the conventional
  sonographic procedure. Materials & Methods We performed prospective free-hand ...
