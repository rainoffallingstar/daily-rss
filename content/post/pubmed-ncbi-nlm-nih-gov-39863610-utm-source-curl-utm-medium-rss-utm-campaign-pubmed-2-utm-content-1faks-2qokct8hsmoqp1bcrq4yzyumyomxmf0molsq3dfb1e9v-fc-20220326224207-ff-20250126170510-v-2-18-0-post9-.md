description: Gut microbiota disruptions after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation
  (alloHCT) are associated with increased risk of acute graft-versus-host disease
  (aGVHD). We designed a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial to test
  whether healthy-donor fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) early after alloHCT
  reduces the incidence of severe aGVHD. Here, we report the results from the single-arm
  run-in phase which identified the best of 3 stool donors for the randomized phase.
