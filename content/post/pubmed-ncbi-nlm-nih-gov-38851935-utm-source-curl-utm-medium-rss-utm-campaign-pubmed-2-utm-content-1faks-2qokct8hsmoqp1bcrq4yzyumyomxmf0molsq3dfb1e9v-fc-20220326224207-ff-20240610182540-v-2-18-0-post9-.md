description: Recently developed long axial field of view (LAFOV) PET-CT scanners,
  including total body scanners, are already in use in a few centers worldwide. These
  systems have some major advantages over standard axial field of view (SAFOV) PET-CT
  scanners, mainly due to up to 20 times higher sensitivity and therefore improved
  lesion detectability. Other advantages are the reduction of the PET acquisition
  time for a static whole-body measurement, the reduction of the administered radiotracer
  dose, and ...
