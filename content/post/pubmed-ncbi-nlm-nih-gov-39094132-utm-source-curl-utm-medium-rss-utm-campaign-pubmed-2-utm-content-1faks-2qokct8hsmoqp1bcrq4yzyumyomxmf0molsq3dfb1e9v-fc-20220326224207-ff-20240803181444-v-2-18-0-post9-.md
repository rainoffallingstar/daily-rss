description: Statistical combinations of searches for charginos and neutralinos using
  various decay channels are performed using 139 fb^{-1} of pp collision data at sqrt[s]=13
  TeV with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Searches targeting pure-wino
  chargino pair production, pure-wino chargino-neutralino production, or Higgsino
  production decaying via standard model W, Z, or h bosons are combined to extend
  the mass reach to the produced supersymmetric particles by 30-100 GeV. The depth
