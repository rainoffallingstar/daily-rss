  critical roles in cellular processes. The identification of cancer driver genes
  is crucial for understanding tumorigenesis, developing targeted therapies and identifying
  rational drug targets. Experimental identification and validation of cancer driver
  genes are time-consuming and costly. Studies have demonstrated that interactions
  among genes are associated with similar phenotypes. Therefore, identifying cancer
