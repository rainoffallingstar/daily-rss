description: Our new paper, with François Hu and Philipp Ratz, Mitigating Discrimination
  in Insurance with Wasserstein Barycenters is now available on ArXiv. The insurance
  industry is heavily reliant on predictions of risks based on characteristics of
  potential customers. Although the use of said models is common, researchers have
  long pointed out that such practices perpetuate discrimination based on sensitive
  features such as gender or race. Given that such discrimination can often be attributed
  to historical data biases, an elimination or at least mitigation is desirable. &#8230;
