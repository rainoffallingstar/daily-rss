description: Evolutionary innovations can be driven by changes in the rates of RNA
  translation and the emergence of new genes and small open reading frames (sORFs).
  In this study, we characterized the transcriptional and translational landscape
  of the hearts of four primate and two rodent species through integrative ribosome
  and transcriptomic profiling, including adult left ventricle tissues and induced
  pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte cell cultures. We show here that the
