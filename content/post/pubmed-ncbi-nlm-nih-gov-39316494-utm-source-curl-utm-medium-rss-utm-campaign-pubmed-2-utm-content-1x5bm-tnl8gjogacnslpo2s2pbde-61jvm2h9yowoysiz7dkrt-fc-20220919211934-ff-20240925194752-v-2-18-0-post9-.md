description: Synthetic Lethal (SL) relationships, though rare among the vast array
  of gene combinations, hold substantial promise for targeted cancer therapy. Despite
  advancements in AI model accuracy, there is still a significant need among domain
  experts for interpretive paths and mechanism explorations that align better with
  domain-specific knowledge, particularly due to the high costs of experimentation.
  To address this gap, we propose an iterative Human-AI collaborative framework with
