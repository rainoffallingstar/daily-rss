description: Acute graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) grading systems that use only clinical
  symptoms at treatment initiation such as Minnesota risk identify standard and high
  risk categories but lack a low risk category suitable to minimize immunosuppressive
  strategies. We developed a new grading system that includes a low risk stratum based
  on clinical symptoms alone and determined whether the incorporation of biomarkers
  would improve the model's prognostic accuracy. We randomly divided 1863 patients
