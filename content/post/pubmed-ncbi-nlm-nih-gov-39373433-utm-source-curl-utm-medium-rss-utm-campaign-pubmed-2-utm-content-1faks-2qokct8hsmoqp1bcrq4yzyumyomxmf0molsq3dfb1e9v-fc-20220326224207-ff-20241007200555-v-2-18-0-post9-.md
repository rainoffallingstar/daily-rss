description: The origin of neutrino masses remains unknown. Both the vacuum mass and
  the dark mass generated by the neutrino interaction with dark matter (DM) particles
  or fields can fit the current oscillation data. The dark mass squared is proportional
  to the DM number density and, therefore, varies on the galactic scale with much
  larger values around the Galactic Center. This affects the group velocity and the
  arrival time delay of core-collapse supernovae (SN) neutrinos. This time delay,
