  <p>Two recent examples of engineering thinking follow. One was in a <a href="https://youtu.be/sIBrFuzR3cs?t=1338">video / podcast interview with Martin Thompson</a> (who is a noted high-performance code expert) I came across recently. The overall focus of the hour-long interview is on ‘managing software complexity’. Around minute twenty-two, the conversation turns to feedback loops and systems, and a strong preference for simple and fast systems for more immediate feedback. An important topic ...
