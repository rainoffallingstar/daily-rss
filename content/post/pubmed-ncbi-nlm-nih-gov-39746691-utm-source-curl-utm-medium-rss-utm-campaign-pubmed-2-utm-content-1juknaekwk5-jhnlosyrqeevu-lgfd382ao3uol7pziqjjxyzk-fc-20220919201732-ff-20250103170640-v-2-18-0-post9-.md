  human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) infection within 100 days after allogeneic hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) and to investigate the association of HHV-6
  viral load with clinical outcomes as well as the effect of antiviral treatment on
  the course of HHV-6 infection. Methods: This retrospective study included patients
  who tested positive for HHV-6 within 100 days after allo-HSCT at the Peking University
