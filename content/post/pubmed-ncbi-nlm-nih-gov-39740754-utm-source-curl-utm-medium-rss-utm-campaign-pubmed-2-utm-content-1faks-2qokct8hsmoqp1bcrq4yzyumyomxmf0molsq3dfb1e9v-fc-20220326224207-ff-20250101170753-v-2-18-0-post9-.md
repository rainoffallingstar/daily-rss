description: Adequate levels of thyroid hormones (THs) in the fetal brain are vital
  for early neurodevelopment. Most of TH in fetal brain is derived from circulating
  thyroxine (T4), which gets locally converted into the biologically active triiodothyronine
  (T3) by deiodinase enzymes. One of the major routes of TH into the brain is through
  the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB). The BCSFB is maintained by the choroid
  plexus (CP), which separates the blood from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). ...
