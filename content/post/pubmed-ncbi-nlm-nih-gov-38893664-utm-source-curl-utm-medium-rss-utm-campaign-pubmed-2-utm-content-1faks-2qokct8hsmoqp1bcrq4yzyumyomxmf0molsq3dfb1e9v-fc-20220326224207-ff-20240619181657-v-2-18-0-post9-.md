description: '(1) Background: Open-source software tools are available to estimate
  proton density fat fraction (PDFF). (2) Methods: We compared four algorithms: complex-based
  with graph cut (GC), magnitude-based (MAG), magnitude-only estimation with Rician
  noise modeling (MAG-R), and multi-scale quadratic pseudo-Boolean optimization with
  graph cut (QPBO). The accuracy and reliability of the methods were evaluated in
  phantoms with known fat/water ratios and a patient cohort with various grades (S0-S3)
