description: Electromerism (aka. valence tautomerism) corresponds to the switching
  of electronic distributions between redox-active ligands and central elements. While
  this phenomenon is well established for several transition metals, the Pd(0)/Pd(II)
  couple could not yet be involved due to the high energy of the Pd(0) state. In this
  study, we present Pd(0)/Pd(II) electromerism by using a redox-active bis(phosphanyl-amidophenolato)silane.
  Strong silicon-based Z-type interaction stabilizes the Pd(0) ...
