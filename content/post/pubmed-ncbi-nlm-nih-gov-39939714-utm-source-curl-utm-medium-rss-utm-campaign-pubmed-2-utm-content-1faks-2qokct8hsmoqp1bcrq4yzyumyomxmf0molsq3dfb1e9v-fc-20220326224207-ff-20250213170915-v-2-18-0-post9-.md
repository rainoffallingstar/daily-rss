description: Rare, germline loss-of-function variants in a handful of DNA repair genes
  are associated with epithelial ovarian cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate
  the role of rare, coding, loss-of-function variants across the genome in epithelial
  ovarian cancer. We carried out a gene-by-gene burden test with various histotypes
  using data from 2573 non-mucinous cases and 13,923 controls. Twelve genes were associated
  at a False Discovery Rate of less than 0.1 of which seven were the known ...
