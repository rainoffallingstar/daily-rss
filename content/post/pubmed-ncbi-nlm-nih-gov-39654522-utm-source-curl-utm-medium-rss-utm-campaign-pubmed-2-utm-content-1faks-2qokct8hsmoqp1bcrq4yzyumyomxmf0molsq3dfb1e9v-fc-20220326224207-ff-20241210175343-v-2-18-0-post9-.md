description: A double primary colorectal cancer (CRC) in a familial setting signals
  a high risk of CRC. In order to identify novel CRC susceptibility genes, we whole-exome
  sequenced germline DNA from nine persons with a double primary CRC and a family
  history of CRC. The detected variants were processed by bioinformatics filtering
  and prioritization, including STRING protein-protein interaction and pathway analysis.
  A total of 150 missense, 19 stop-gain, 22 frameshift and 13 canonical splice site
