description: Neuropsychiatric disorders lack effective treatments due to a limited
  understanding of underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. To address this,
  we integrated population-scale single-cell genomics data and analyzed cell-type-level
  gene regulatory networks across schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism (23
  cell classes/subclasses). Our analysis revealed potential druggable transcription
  factors co-regulating known risk genes that converge into cell-type-specific co-regulated
  modules. ...
