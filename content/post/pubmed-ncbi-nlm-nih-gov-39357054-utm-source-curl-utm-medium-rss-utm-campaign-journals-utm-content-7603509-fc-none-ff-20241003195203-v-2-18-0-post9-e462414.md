description: Complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy or hemolytic uremic syndrome
  (CM-TMA/CM-HUS), previously identified as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, is
  a thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by germline variants or acquired antibodies
  to complement proteins and regulators. Building upon our prior experience with the
  modified Ham (mHam) assay for ex vivo diagnosis of complementopathies, we have developed
  an array of cell-based complement "biosensors' by selective removal of ...
