description: Zebrafish larvae show a rapid increase in cortisol in response to acute
  stressors, followed by a decline. While these responses are documented, both the
  duration of the refractory period to repeated stressors and the role of glucocorticoid
  receptors (GR) in specific phases of the glucocorticoid negative feedback are still
  being clarified. We explored these questions using water vortices as stressors,
  combined with GR blockage and measurements of whole-body cortisol in zebrafish larvae
