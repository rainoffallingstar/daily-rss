description: In neuronal cells, the regulation of RNA is crucial for the spatiotemporal
  control of gene expression, but how the correct localization, levels, and function
  of synaptic proteins are achieved is not well understood. In this study, we globally
  investigate the role of alternative 3' UTRs in regulating RNA localization in the
  synaptic regions of the Drosophila brain. We identify direct mRNA targets of the
  translational repressor Pumilio, finding that mRNAs bound by Pumilio encode proteins
