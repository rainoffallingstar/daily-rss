description: We present Sci-ModoM, the first next-generation RNome database offering
  a holistic view of the epitranscriptomic landscape. Sci-ModoM has a simple yet powerful
  interface, underpinned by FAIR data principles, a standardized nomenclature, and
  interoperable formats, fostering the use of common standards within the epitranscriptomics
  community. Sci-ModoM provides quantitative measurements per site and dataset, enabling
  users to assess confidence levels based on score, coverage, and ...
