description: The retina, whose basic cellular structure is highly conserved across
  vertebrates, constitutes an accessible system for studying the central nervous system.
  In recent years, single-cell RNA sequencing studies have uncovered cellular diversity
  in the retina of a variety of species, providing new insights on retinal evolution
  and development. However, similar data in cartilaginous fishes, the sister group
  to all other extant jawed vertebrates, are still lacking. Here, we present a ...
