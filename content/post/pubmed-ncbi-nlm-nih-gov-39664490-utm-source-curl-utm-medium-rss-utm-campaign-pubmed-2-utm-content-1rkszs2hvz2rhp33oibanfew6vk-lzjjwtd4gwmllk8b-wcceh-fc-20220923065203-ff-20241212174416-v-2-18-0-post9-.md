  in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus. In over 90% of cases, it
  occurs at CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts of less than 100 cells/mm³. Cryptococcomas
  are rare granulomatous lesions that can occur in disseminated central nervous system
  cryptococcal infection, primarily in immunocompetent hosts. Here we report a case
