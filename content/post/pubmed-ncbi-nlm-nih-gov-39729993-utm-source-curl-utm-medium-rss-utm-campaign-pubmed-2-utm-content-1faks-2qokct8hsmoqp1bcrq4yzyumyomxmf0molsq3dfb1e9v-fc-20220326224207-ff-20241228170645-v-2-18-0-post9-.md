description: Changing environmental conditions necessitate rapid adaptation of cytoplasmic
  and nuclear volumes. We use the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, known for its
  ability to tolerate extreme changes in osmolarity, to assess which role nuclear
  pore complexes (NPCs) play in achieving nuclear volume adaptation and relieving
  mechanical stress. We capitalize on the unique properties of D. discoideum to quantify
