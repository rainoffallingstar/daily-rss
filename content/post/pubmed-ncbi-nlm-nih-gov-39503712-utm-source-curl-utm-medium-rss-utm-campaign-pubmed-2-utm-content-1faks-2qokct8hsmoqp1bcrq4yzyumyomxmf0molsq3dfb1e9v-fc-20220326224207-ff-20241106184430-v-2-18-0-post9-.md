description: To interrogate the importance of intermolecular interactions on charge
  transport at the nanoscale, we investigate molecular tunnel junctions based on mixed
  self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of 1-alkyl (CnT) thiols and their fluorinated counterparts
  (F-CnT) that have substantially different tunneling conductances. Experiments on
  mixed CnT(1-x):F-CnT(x) SAMs between Au contacts reveal a strongly nonlinear (exponential)
  dependence of the tunneling conductance G on composition x, a behavior that ...
