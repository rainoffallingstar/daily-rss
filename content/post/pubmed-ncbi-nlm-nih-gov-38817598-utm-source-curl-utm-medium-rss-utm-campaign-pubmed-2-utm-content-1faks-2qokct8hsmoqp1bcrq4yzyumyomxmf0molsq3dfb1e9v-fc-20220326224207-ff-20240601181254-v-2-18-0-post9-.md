description: In recent years, new targeted therapies have been developed to treat
  patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor
  2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer. Some of these therapies have not just become the
  new therapy standard but also led to significantly longer overall survival rates.
  The cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) have become the therapeutic
  standard for first-line therapy. Around 70 - 80% of patients are treated with a
  CDK4/6i. ...
