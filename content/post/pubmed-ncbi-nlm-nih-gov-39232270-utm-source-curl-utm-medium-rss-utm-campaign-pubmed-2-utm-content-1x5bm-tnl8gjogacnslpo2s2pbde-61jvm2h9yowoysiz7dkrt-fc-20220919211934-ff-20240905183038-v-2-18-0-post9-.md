description: The integration of morphological attributes extracted from histopathological
  images and genomic data holds significant importance in advancing tumor diagnosis,
  prognosis, and grading. Histopathological images are acquired through microscopic
  examination of tissue slices, providing valuable insights into cellular structures
  and pathological features. On the other hand, genomic data provides information
  about tumor gene expression and functionality. The fusion of these two distinct
  data types ...
