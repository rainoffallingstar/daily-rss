description: The evolutionarily conserved Hox genes define segment identities along
  the anterior-posterior axis and are expressed in most cell types within each segment,

  previously that Drosophila adult flight muscles in the second thoracic segment (T2)
  develop without direct Hox gene input, relying instead on ectodermal signals to
  shape their identity. However, our research, leveraging single-cell transcriptomics
