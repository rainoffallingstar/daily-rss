  the prognostic impact of cytogenetic abnormalities by FISH in 283 patients with
  AL amyloidosis treated with frontline daratumumab-bortezomib-cyclophosphamide-dexamethasone
  (Dara-VCD) or Dara-VD. The cytogenetic subgroups of interest were t(11;14), gain/amp(1q)

  (HR) translocations (t[4;14], t[14;16], or t[14;20]). The endpoints of interest
