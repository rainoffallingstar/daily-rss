description: Obesity is defined as the excessive accumulation of adipose tissue and
  is currently the most common disease in cats. Similarly to humans, obesity negatively
  impacts the health and welfare of cats, predisposing them to many other disorders.
  The objective of this study was to compare the serum proteomes of normal-weight
  and overweight/obese cats, aiming to gain insights into the physiopathology of feline
