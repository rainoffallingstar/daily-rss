description: Kv1.3 is a multifunctional potassium channel implicated in multiple pathologies,
  including cancer. However, how it is involved in disease progression is not fully
  clear. We interrogated the interactome of Kv1.3 in intact cells using BioID proximity
  labeling, revealing that Kv1.3 interacts with STAT3- and p53-linked pathways. To
  prove the relevance of Kv1.3 and of its interactome in the context of tumorigenesis,
