description: Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) fuels cellular ATP demands.
  OXPHOS defects lead to severe human disorders with unexplained tissue specific pathologies.
  Mitochondrial gene expression is essential for OXPHOS biogenesis since core subunits
  of the complexes are mitochondrial-encoded. COX14 is required for translation of
  COX1, the central mitochondrial-encoded subunit of complex IV. Here we describe
  a COX14 mutant mouse corresponding to a patient with complex IV ...
