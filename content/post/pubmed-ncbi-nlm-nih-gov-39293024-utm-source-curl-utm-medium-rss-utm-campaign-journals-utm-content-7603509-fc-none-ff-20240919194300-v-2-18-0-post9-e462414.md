description: A "restrictive" red blood cell transfusion threshold, hemoglobin concentration
  <7-8 g/dL, has long been recommended for most hospitalized patients including anemic
  patients with stable cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although no threshold recommendation
  is given for acute coronary syndromes (ACS), recent evidence suggests that "liberal"
  rather than "restrictive" transfusion strategies are associated with significantly
  improved safety for hospitalized patients with stable CVD and/or ACS. ...
