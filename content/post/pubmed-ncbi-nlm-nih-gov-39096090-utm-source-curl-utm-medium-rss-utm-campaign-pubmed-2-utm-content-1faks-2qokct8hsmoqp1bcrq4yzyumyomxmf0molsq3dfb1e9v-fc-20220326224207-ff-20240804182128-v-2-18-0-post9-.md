description: Esophageal cancer (EC) and gastric cancer (GC) are fatal cancers with
  a relatively late age of onset. Age is a negative risk factor for survival in many
  cancers and our aim was to analyze age-specific survival in EC and GC using the
  recently updated NORDCAN database. NORDCAN data originate from the Danish, Finnish,
  Norwegian, and Swedish nationwide cancer registries covering years 1972 through
  2021 inviting for comparison of 50-year survival trends between the countries. Relative
