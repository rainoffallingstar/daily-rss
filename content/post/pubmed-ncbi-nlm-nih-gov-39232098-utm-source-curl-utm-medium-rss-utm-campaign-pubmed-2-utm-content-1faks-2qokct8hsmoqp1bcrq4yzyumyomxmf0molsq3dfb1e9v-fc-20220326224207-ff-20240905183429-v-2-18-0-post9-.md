  patients' survival even after curative resection. Currently, there is no highly
  accurate marker for detecting the presence of lymph node metastasis. The SEMA3F/NRP2
  axis was initially characterized in axon guidance and recent evidence has revealed
  its significant involvement in lymphangiogenesis, angiogenesis, and carcinogenesis.
