description: Vδ1 T cells are a subpopulation of γδT cells found in human dermis. In
  contrast to murine skin-resident γδT cells, much less is known regarding their role
  and function in skin health and disease. Here we report the successful integration
  of Vδ1 T cells into long-term fibroblast-derived matrix skin equivalents (SE). We
  isolated Vδ1 T cells from human blood, where they are rare, and established conditions
  for the integration and maintenance of the freshly isolated Vδ1 T cells in the SEs.
