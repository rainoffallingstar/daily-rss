description: Identifying essential proteins is of utmost importance in the field of
  biomedical research due to their essential functions in cellular activities and
  their involvement in mechanisms related to diseases. In this research, a novel approach
  called AttentionEP for predicting essential proteins (EP) is introduced by attention
  mechanisms. This method leverages both cross-attention and self-attention frameworks,
  focusing on enhancing prediction accuracy through the integration of features ...
