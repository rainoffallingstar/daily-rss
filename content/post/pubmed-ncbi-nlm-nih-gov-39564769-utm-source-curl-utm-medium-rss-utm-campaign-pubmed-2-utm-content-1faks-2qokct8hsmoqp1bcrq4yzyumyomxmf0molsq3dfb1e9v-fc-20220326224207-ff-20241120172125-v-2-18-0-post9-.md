description: Trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2) exhibits aberrant expression
  in pancreatic cancer, correlating with metastasis, advanced tumor stage and poor
  prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. TROP2 has been recognized
  as a promising therapeutic target for antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), as evidenced
  by the approval of the anti-TROP2 ADC Trodelvy® for the treatment of triple negative
  breast cancer. In this study we report the generation of novel second-generation
