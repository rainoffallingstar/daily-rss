  targeted drugs for various tumor entities are approved or are in development. Personalized
  pharmacotherapy in oncology has so far been based primarily on tumor characteristics,
  for example, somatic mutations. However, the response to drug treatment also depends
  on pharmacological processes summarized under the term ADME (absorption, distribution,
