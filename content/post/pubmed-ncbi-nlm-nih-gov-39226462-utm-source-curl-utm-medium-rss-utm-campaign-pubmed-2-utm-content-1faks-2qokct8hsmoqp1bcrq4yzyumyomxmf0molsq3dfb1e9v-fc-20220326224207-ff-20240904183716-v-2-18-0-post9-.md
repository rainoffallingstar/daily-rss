description: Genetic studies have identified numerous regions associated with plasma
  fibrinogen levels in Europeans, yet missing heritability and limited inclusion of
  non-Europeans necessitates further studies with improved power and sensitivity.
  Compared with array-based genotyping, whole genome sequencing (WGS) data provides
  better coverage of the genome and better representation of non-European variants.
  To better understand the genetic landscape regulating plasma fibrinogen levels,
  we meta-analyzed ...
