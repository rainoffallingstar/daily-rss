description: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading cause of death from an infectious
  disease worldwide, partly due to a lack of effective strategies to screen and triage
  individuals with potential TB. Whole blood RNA signatures have been tested as biomarkers
  for TB, but have failed to meet the World Health Organization's (WHO) optimal target
  product profiles (TPP). Here, we use RNA sequencing and machine-learning to investigate
  the utility of plasma cell-free RNA (cfRNA) as a host-response biomarker for TB
