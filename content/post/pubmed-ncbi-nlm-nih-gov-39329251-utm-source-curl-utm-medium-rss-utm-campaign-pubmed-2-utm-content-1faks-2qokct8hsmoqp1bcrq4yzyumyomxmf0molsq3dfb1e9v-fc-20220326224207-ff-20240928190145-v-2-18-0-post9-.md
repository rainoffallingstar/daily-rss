description: Negatively curved nanographenes are considered as cutouts of three-dimensional
  fully sp²-hybridized carbon allotropes such as Schwarzites. Here we present the
  synthesis of a C(76) cut-out of the Schwarzite 8-4-1-p proposed by Lenosky et al.
  and investigate its optical as well as electrochemical properties. Furthermore,
  supramolecular interactions with fullerenes C(60) and C(70) were ...
