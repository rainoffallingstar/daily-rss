description: Therapeutic measures aimed at optimising organ function prior to transplantation-whether
  by conditioning the donor after determination of brain death or by improving organ
  preservation after kidney removal-have the potential to enhance outcomes after transplantation.
  The particular advantage is that, unlike any optimised immunosuppressive therapy,
  a favourable effect can be achieved without side effects for the organ recipient.
  In recent years, several such measures have been tested ...
