description: 'CONCLUSION: OML-Combine facilitates the harmonization of neuropsychological
  test data from established AD cohort studies. Visualization of predicted test scores
  and the original data sets can thereby assist with decisions about accuracy of harmonized
  data and can provide a basis for adjustment of inputs to optimize models. This allows
  researchers to combine their own data with that from other currently available studies
  to improve diagnostic and prognostic models of AD. References: ...'
