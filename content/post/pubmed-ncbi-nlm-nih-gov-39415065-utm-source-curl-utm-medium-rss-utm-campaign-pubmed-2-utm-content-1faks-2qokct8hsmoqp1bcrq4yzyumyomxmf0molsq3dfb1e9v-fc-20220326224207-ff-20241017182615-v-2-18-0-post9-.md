  produced by accretion onto a spinning black hole. Microquasars are near enough to
  allow detailed imaging of spatial features across the multiwavelength spectrum.
  The recent extension measurement of the spatial morphology of a microquasar, SS
  433, to TeV gamma rays¹ localizes the acceleration of electrons at shocks in the
  jet far from the black hole². V4641 Sagittarii (V4641 Sgr) is a similar binary system
