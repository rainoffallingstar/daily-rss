description: 'INTRODUCTION: The Trk family proteins are membrane-bound kinases predominantly
  expressed in neuronal tissues. Activated by neurotrophins, they regulate critical
  cellular processes through downstream signaling pathways. Dysregulation of Trk signaling
  can drive a range of diseases, making the design and study of Trk inhibitors a vital
  area of research. This review explores recent advances in the development of type
