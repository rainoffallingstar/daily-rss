description: FOLFIRI, a combination of folinic acid, 5-Fluorouracil, and Irinotecan,
  is one of the recommended first-line chemotherapeutic treatments for metastatic
  colorectal cancer (mCRC). Unfortunately, acquired FOLFIRI resistance represents
  a common obstacle in the treatment of mCRC patients. Thus, we aimed to identify
  mechanisms, gene alterations and gene expression signatures contributing to acquired
  FOLFIRI resistance by mimicking this problem in a cell culture model and subsequent
  translation ...
