description: Chromothripsis is a mutational phenomenon in which a single catastrophic
  event generates extensive rearrangements of one or a few chromosomes. This extreme
  form of genome instability has been detected in 30-50% of cancers. Studies conducted
  in the past few years have uncovered insights into how chromothripsis arises and
  deciphered some of the cellular and molecular consequences of chromosome shattering.
