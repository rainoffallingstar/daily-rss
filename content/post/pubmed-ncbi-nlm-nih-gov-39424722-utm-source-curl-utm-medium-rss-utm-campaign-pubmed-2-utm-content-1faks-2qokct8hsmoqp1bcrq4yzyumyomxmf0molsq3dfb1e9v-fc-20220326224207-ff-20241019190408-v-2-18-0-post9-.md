description: The majority of lymphomas originate from B cells at the germinal center
  stage. Preferential selection of B-cell clones by a limited set of antigens has
  been suggested to drive lymphoma development. While recent studies in B-cell chronic
  lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have shown that self-reactive B-cell receptors (BCR)
  can generate cell-autonomous signaling and proliferation, our knowledge about the
  role of BCRs for the development or survival of other lymphomas remains limited.
  Here, we describe ...
