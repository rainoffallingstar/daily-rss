description: Knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia has
  advanced in recent years. Despite novel treatment options, acute myeloid leukemia
  remains a survival challenge for elderly patients. We have recently shown that the
  triphosphohydrolase SAMHD1 is one of the factors determining resistance to Ara-C
  treatment. Here, we designed and tested novel and simpler virus-like particles incorporating
  the lentiviral protein Vpx to efficiently and transiently degrade SAMHD1 and increase
