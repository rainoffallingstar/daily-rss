description: Gallbladder cancer (GBC) presents as an aggressive malignancy with poor
  patient outcome. Like other epithelial cancers, the mechanisms of GBC cancer progression
  remain vague and efforts in finding targeted therapies fall below expectations.
  This study combined proteomic analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
