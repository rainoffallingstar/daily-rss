description: Measuring pre-diagnostic blood metabolites may help identify novel risk
  factors for prostate cancer. Using data from 4387 matched case-control pairs from
  the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, we
  investigated the associations of 148 individual metabolites and three previously
  defined metabolite patterns with prostate cancer risk. Metabolites were measured
  by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic
