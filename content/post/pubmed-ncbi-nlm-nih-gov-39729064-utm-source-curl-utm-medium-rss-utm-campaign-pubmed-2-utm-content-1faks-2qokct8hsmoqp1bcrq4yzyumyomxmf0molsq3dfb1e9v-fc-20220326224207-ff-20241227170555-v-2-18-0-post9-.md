  of cellular signaling and as potential drug targets. Functional annotation of the
  7 human isoforms would benefit from isoform-selective inhibitors, allowing studies
  on the role of these enzymes in normal physiology and disease pathogenesis. However,
  due to significant sequence homology within the catalytic domain, isoform selectivity
  is difficult to achieve with conventional small molecules. Here, we used a ...
