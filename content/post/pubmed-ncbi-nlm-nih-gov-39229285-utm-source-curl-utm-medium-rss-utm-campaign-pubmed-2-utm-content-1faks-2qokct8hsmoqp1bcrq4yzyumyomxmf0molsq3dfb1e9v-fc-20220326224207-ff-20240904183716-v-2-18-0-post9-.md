  have been associated with a lower risk of developing nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC),
  although the evidence remains inconclusive and unexplained. We conducted a longitudinal
  study within a high-risk Taiwanese cohort, analyzing total immunoglobulin against
  EBV-gp350 and -gH/gL in blood and EBV DNA shedding in saliva. Contrary to our hypothesis-that
  elevated levels of antibodies previously shown to be associated with a lower ...
