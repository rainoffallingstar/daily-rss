description: Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are key immune regulators that have shown
  promise in enhancing cardiac repair post-MI, although the mechanisms remain elusive.
  Here, we show that rapidly increasing Treg number in the circulation post-MI via
  systemic administration of exogenous Tregs improves cardiac function in male mice,
  by limiting cardiomyocyte death and reducing fibrosis. Mechanistically, exogenous
  Tregs quickly home to the infarcted heart and adopt an injury-specific transcriptome
