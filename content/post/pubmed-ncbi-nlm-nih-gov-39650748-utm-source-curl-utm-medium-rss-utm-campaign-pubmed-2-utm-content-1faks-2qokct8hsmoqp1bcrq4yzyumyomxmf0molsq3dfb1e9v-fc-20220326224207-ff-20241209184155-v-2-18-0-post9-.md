description: The projected sensitivity of the effective electron neutrino-mass measurement
  with the KATRIN experiment is below 0.3 eV (90 % CL) after 5 years of data acquisition.
  The sensitivity is affected by the increased rate of the background electrons from
  KATRIN's main spectrometer. A special shifted-analysing-plane (SAP) configuration
  was developed to reduce this background by a factor of two. The complex layout of
  electromagnetic fields in the SAP configuration requires a robust method of ...
