description: Single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) enables decoding somatic cancer
  variation. Existing methods are hampered by low throughput or cannot be combined
  with transcriptome sequencing in the same cell. We propose HIPSD&R-seq (HIgh-throughPut
  Single-cell Dna and Rna-seq), a scalable yet simple and accessible assay to profile
  low-coverage DNA and RNA in thousands of cells in parallel. Our approach builds
  on a modification of the 10X Genomics platform for scATAC and multiome profiling.
