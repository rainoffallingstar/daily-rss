description: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPi) have revolutionized cancer immunotherapy
  but also can induce autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), a severe disease with high
  mortality. However, the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) of ICPi-AIHA are unclear,
  other than being initiated through decreased checkpoint inhibition. Herein, we report
  ICPi-AIHA in a novel mouse model that shows similar characteristics of known human
  ICPi-AIHA (e.g., autoantibodies, hemolysis, increased mortality). During ...
