description: Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma associated with
  poor outcomes in patients with relapsed/refractory disease. This multicenter, retrospective
  study evaluated real-world CD19 CAR T-cell therapy outcomes in patients with relapsed/refractory
  BL using data abstracted from the medical records. In total, 31 patients received
  CAR T-cells after a median of 3 prior therapies (range 1-6). Patients received axi-cel
