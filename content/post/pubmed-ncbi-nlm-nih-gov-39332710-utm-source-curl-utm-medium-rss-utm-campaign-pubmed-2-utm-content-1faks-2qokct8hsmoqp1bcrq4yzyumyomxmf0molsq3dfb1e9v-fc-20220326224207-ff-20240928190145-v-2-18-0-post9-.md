description: Tumors of the major and minor salivary gland histologically encompass
  a diverse and partly overlapping spectrum of frequently diagnostically challenging
  neoplasms. Despite recent advances in molecular testing and the identification of
  tumor-specific mutations or gene fusions, there is an unmet need to identify additional
  diagnostic biomarkers for entities lacking specific alterations. In this study,
  we collected a comprehensive cohort of 363 cases encompassing 20 different salivary
