  treatment modality for many malignant haematological disorders. In the absence of
  a matched related donor (MRD), matched unrelated donors (MUD) and haploidentical
  donors (Haplo-Tx) are the most important sources of stem cells. However, multicenter
  real-life data which compare 10/10 MUD transplantations with Haplo-Tx is still limited.
