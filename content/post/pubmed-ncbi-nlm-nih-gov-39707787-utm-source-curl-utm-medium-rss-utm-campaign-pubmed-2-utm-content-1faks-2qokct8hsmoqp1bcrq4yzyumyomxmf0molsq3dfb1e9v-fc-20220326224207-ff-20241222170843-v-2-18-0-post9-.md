description: HIV-2 infection although less virulent compared to HIV-1 is endemic in
  many parts of West Africa. In Burkina Faso, few data exist on HIV-2 genotypic resistance.
  The objective of this study was to assess HIV-2 genotypic resistance and viral load
  in adult patients infected with HIV-2 in Burkina Faso. This was a cross-sectional
  study that ran from February 2017 to March 2019. This study included 91 HIV-infected
  adult patients on ARV treatment. HIV and hepatitis B and C status were confirmed
