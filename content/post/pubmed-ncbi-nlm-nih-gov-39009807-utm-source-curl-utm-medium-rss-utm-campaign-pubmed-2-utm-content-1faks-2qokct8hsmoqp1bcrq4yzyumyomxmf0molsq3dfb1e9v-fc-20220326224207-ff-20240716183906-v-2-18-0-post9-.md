description: Long-acting passive immunization strategies are needed to protect immunosuppressed
  vulnerable groups from infectious diseases. To further explore this concept for
  COVID-19, we constructed Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors encoding the human
  variable regions of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody, TRES6, fused to murine
  constant regions. An optimized vector construct was packaged in hepatotropic (AAV8)
  or myotropic (AAVMYO) AAV capsids and injected intravenously into syngeneic ...
