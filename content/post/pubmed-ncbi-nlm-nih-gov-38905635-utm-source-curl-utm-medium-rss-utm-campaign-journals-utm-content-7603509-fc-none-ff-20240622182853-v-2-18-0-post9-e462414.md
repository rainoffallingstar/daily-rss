description: The interaction between menin and histone-lysine N-methyltransferase
  2A (KMT2A) is a critical dependency for KMT2A- or nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1)-altered
  leukemias and an emerging opportunity for therapeutic development. JNJ-75276617
  is a novel, orally bioavailable, potent, and selective protein-protein interaction
  inhibitor of the binding between menin and KMT2A. In KMT2A-rearranged (KMT2A-r)
  and NPM1-mutant (NPM1c) AML cells, JNJ-75276617 inhibited the association of the
  menin-KMT2A complex ...
