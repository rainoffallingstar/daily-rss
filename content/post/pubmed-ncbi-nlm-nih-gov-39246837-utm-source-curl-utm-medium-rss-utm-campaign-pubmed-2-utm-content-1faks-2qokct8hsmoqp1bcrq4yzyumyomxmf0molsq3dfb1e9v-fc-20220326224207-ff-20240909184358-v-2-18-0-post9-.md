description: Photoimmunotherapy (PIT) combines the specificity of antibodies with
  the cytotoxicity of light activatable photosensitizers (PS) and is a promising new
  cancer therapy. We designed and synthesized, in a highly convergent manner, the
  silicon phthalocyanine dye WB692-CB2, which is novel for being the first light-activatable
  PS that can be directly conjugated via a maleimide linker to cysteines. In the present
  study we conjugated WB692-CB2 to a humanized antibody with engineered cysteines
