description: The success of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT)
  can be limited by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). T-cell activation is a key factor
  in GVHD progression. Costimulatory signals can be counterbalanced by co-inhibitory
  signals such as the checkpoint molecule VISTA (V-domain Ig-containing suppressor
  of T-cell activation)/PD-1H that restrains activation and maintains donor T-cell
  quiescence. A single dose of anti-VISTA mAb prevents acute GVHD lethality in ...
