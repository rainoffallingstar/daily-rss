description: Multiple myeloma (MM)-induced bone disease affects not only patients'
  quality of life but also their overall survival. Our previous work demonstrated
  that the gut microbiome plays a crucial role in MM progression and drug resistance.
  However, the role of altered gut microbiota in MM bone disease remains unclear.
  In this study, we show that intestinal E. cloacae is significantly enriched in MM
