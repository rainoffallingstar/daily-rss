description: Epstein Barr Virus-positive mucocutaneous ulcer (EBVMCU) can be difficult
  to distinguish from EBV-positive diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We used
  targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) to explore genetic alterations in EBVMCU
  to aid in this diagnostic challenge. Ten cases of EBVMCU were evaluated by a targeted
  NGS panel of 164 genes. Targeted NGS identified 18 variants in 15 genes in eight
  cases of EBVMCU. Loss of function TET2 variants were most frequently identified
  (3 of 10 ...
