description: X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA) is a congenital anemia caused by
  mutations in ALAS2, a gene responsible for heme synthesis. Treatments are limited
  to pyridoxine supplements and blood transfusions, offering no definitive cure except
  for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, only accessible to a subset
  of patients. The absence of a suitable animal model has hindered the development
  of gene therapy research for this disease. We engineered a conditional Alas2-KO
  mouse model ...
