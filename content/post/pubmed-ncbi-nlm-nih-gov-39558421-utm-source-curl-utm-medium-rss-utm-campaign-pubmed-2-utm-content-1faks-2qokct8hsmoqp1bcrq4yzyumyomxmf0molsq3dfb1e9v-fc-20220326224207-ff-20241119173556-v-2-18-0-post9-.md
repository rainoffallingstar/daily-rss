description: There is an unmet need for a more accurate molecular imaging radiotracer
  in the field of non-seminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCT). The clinical problem
  is that no single imaging modality is able to differentiate teratoma from necrotic
  tissue in NSGCTs, which the nuclear medicine techniques are no exception. The exponential
  growth in the list of potentially promising radiotracers may hold promise in the
  future for imaging of NSGCTs. Here, we have reviewed the past efforts and potential
