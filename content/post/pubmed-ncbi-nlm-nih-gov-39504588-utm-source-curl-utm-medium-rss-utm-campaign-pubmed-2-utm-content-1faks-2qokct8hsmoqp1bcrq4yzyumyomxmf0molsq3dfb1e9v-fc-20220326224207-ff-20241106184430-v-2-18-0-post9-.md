description: Repression of msl-2 mRNA translation is essential for viability of Drosophila
  melanogaster females to prevent hypertranscription of both X chromosomes. This translational
  control event is coordinated by the female-specific protein Sex-lethal (Sxl) which
  recruits the RNA binding proteins Unr and Hrp48 to the 3' untranslated region (UTR)
  of the msl-2 transcript and represses translation initiation. The mechanism exerted
  by Hrp48 during translation repression and its interaction with msl-2 are ...
