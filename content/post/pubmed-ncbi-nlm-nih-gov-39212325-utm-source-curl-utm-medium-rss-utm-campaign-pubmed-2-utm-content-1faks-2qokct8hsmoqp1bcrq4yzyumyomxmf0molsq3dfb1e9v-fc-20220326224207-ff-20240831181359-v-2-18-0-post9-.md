description: Meningiomas are the most frequent primary intracranial tumors. Hence,
  they constitute a major share of diagnostic specimens in neuropathology practice.
  The 2021 WHO Classification of Central Nervous System Tumors ("CNS5") has introduced
  the first molecular grading parameters for meningioma with oncogenic variants in
  the TERT promoter and homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/B as markers for CNS WHO grade
  3. However, after publication of the new classification volume, clarifications were
