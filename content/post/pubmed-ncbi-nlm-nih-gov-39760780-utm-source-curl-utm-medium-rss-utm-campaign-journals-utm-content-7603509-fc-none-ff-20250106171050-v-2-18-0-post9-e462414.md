description: High-dose methotrexate (MTX) results in high rates of acute kidney injury
  (AKI), neutropenia, and hepatotoxicity. Glucarpidase is a recombinant enzyme that
  cleaves MTX, but clinical data supporting its use are scarce. We examined the association
  between glucarpidase administration and outcomes in adults with MTX-AKI from 28
  cancer centers across the U.S using a sequential target trial emulation framework.
  The primary end point was kidney recovery at hospital discharge, defined as survival
