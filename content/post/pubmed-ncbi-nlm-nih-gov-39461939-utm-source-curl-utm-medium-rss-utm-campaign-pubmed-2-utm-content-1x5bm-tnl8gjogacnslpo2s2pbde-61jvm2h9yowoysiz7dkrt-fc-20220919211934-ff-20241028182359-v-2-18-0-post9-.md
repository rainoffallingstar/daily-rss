description: Metagenomics can provide insight into the microbial taxa present in a
  sample and, through gene identification, the functional potential of the community.
  However, taxonomic and functional information are typically considered separately
  in downstream analyses. We develop interpretable machine learning (ML) approaches
  for modelling metagenomic data, combining the biological representation of species
  with their associated genetically encoded functions within models. We apply our
