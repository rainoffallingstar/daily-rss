description: A multitude of available intraocular lens (IOL) models enable a personalized
  approach to presbyopia correction in order to meet each patient's needs. This review
  article discusses more complex approaches which can be useful in selected cases.
  The concept of reversible trifocality enables correction of presbyopia using a supplementary
  intraocular lens (IOL), which can be removed if necessary (e.g., intolerance to
  multifocal optics). The use of capsulotomy-fixated IOLs enables high precision ...
