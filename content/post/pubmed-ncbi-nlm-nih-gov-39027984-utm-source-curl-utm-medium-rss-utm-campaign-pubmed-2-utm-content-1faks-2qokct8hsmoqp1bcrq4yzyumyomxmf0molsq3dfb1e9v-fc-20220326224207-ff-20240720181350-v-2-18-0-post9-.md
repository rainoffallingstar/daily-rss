description: Amyloid β (Aβ) peptides accumulating in the brain are proposed to trigger
  Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, molecular cascades underlying their toxicity
  are poorly defined. Here, we explored a novel hypothesis for Aβ42 toxicity that
  arises from its proven affinity for γ-secretases. We hypothesized that the reported
  increases in Aβ42, particularly in the endolysosomal compartment, promote the establishment
  of a product feedback inhibitory mechanism on γ-secretases, and thereby impair ...
