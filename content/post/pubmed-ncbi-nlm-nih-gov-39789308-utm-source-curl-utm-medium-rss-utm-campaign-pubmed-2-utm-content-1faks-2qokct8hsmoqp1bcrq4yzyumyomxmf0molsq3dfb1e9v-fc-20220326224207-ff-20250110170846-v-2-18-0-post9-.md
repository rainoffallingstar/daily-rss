description: Postoperative fever following neuroendoscopic procedures has been well-documented,
  yet specific differentiation based on the nature and site of the procedure remains
  lacking. Given the anatomical involvement of the hypothalamus in temperature regulation,
  we propose that endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) may have a distinct impact
  on postoperative fever. This study aims to investigate this phenomenon. This retrospective
