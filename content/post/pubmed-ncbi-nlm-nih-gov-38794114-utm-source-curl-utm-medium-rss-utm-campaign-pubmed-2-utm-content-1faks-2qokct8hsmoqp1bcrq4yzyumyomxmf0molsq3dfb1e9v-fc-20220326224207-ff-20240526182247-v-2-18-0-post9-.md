description: The inhibition of O-acetyl sulphydrylase synthase isoforms has been reported
  to represent a promising approach for the development of antibiotic adjuvants. This
  occurs via the organism developing an unpaired oxidative stress response, causing
  a reduction in antibiotic resistance in vegetative and swarm cell populations. This
  consequently increases the effectiveness of conventional antibiotics at lower doses.
  This study aimed to predict potential inhibitors of Salmonella typhimurium ortho
