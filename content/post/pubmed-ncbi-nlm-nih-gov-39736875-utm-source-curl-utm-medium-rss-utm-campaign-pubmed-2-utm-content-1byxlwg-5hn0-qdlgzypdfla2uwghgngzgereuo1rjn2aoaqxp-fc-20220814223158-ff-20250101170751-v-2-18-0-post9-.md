description: Leukemia, a life-threatening form of cancer, poses a significant global
  health challenge affecting individuals of all age groups, including both children
  and adults. Currently, the diagnostic process relies on manual analysis of microscopic
  images of blood samples. In recent years, machine learning employing deep learning
  approaches has emerged as cutting-edge solutions for image classification problems.
