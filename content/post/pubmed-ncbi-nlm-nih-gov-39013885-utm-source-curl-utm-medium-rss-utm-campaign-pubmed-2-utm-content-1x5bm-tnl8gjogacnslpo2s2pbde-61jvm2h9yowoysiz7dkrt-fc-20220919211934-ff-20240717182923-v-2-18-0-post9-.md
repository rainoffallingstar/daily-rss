description: Cancer is rarely the straightforward consequence of an abnormality in
  a single gene, but rather reflects a complex interplay of many genes, represented
  as gene modules. Here, we leverage the recent advances of model-agnostic interpretation
  approach and develop CGMega, an explainable and graph attention-based deep learning
  framework to perform cancer gene module dissection. CGMega outperforms current approaches
  in cancer gene prediction, and it provides a promising approach to ...
