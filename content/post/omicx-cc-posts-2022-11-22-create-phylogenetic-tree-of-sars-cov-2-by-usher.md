description: <p>There are nearly 14 million viral genome sequences right now in the
  GISAID EpiCoV ™ database. It is not likely to infer the phylogenetic relationships
  for such a huge dataset by traditional maximum likelyhood or Bayesian methods in
  a shor time period. The UShER package was developed to generate ultra-large phylogenetic
  tree of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The algorithm of the UShER program is to place new samples
  onto an existing phylogeny using maximum parsimony method. It is able to place given
  SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences into the GISAID global phylogeny in a couple of hours.
  This program is ...
