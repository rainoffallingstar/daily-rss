description: Cells can sense geometrical cues with sizes of several tens of micrometers
  in their vicinity. Recent in vitro studies show that cells can adapt their shape,
  align along specific directions, or regulate other cellular functions when grown
  on surfaces with curvatures larger than their size. Although possible mechanisms
  for such responses like the alignment along axial cues have been suggested, a detailed
  understanding of the involved cellular processes remains open. This work addresses
