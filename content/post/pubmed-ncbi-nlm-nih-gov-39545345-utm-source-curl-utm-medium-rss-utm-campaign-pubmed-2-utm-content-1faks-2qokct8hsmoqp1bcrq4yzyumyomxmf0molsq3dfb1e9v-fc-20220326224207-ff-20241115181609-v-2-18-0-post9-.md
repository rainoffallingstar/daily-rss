description: Single-particle tracking (SPT) has become a powerful tool to monitor
  the dynamics of membrane proteins in living cells. However, permanent labeling strategies
  for SPT suffer from photobleaching as a major limitation, restricting observation
  times, and obstructing the study of long-term cellular processes within single living
  cells. Here, we use exchangeable HaloTag Ligands (xHTLs) as an easy-to-apply labeling
  approach for live-cell SPT and demonstrate extended observation times of ...
