description: Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) improves the sensitivity
  of NMR but depending on the spin exchange kinetics, it can require substantial RF
  energy deposition to label magnetization. Potential side effects like RF-induced
  heating may occur and must be monitored. Here, we explore the parameter space considering
  not only undesired heating but efficient CEST build-up (depolarization rate), spectral
  resolution (line width), and subsequent effects like changes in chemical shifts
