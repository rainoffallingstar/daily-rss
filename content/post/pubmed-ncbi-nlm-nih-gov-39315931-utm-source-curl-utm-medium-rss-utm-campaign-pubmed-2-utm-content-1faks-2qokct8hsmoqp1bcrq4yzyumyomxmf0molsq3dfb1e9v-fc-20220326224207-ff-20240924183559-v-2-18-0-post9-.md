description: Blood biomarkers are an emerging diagnostic and prognostic tool that
  reflect a range of neuropathological processes following traumatic brain injury
  (TBI). Their effectiveness in identifying long-term neuropathological processes
  after TBI is unclear. Studying biomarkers in the chronic phase is vital because
  elevated levels in TBI might result from distinct neuropathological mechanisms during
  acute and chronic phases. Here, we examine plasma biomarkers in the chronic period
  following TBI ...
