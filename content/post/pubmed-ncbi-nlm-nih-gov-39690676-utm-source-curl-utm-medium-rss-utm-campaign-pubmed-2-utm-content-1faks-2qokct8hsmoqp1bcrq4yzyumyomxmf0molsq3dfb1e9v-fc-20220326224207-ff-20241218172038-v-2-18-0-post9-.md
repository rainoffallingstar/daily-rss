description: Collagen, the most abundant protein in the human body, must withstand
  high mechanical loads due to its structural role in tendons, skin, bones, and other
  connective tissue. It was recently found that tensed collagen creates mechanoradicals
  by homolytic bond scission. We here employ scale-bridging simulations to determine
  the influence of collagen's mesoscale fibril structure on molecular breakages, combining
  atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with a newly developed ...
