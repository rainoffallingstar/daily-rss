description: 'Cetuximab induces responses in about 13% of head and neck squamous cell
  carcinomas (HNSCC). We describe the molecular mechanism of acquired resistance to
  cetuximab, which could be overcome by switching to a different anti-EGFR antibody.
  Biopsies were collected at three different time points: before the start of cetuximab
  (PRE-cetux), at acquired resistance to cetuximab (AR-cetux), and at acquired resistance
  to duligotuzumab (AR-duligo). Biopsies were analyzed using tumor and normal ...'
