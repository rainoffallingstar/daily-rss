description: 'Objectives: To evaluate the impact of surface conditioning of titanium,
  zirconia thickness, and cement type on the final color of zirconia luted to the
  titanium. Methods: A total of 192 grade 5 titanium specimens with the final dimensions
  10 mm × 10 mm × 2 mm were fabricated and subjected to four different surface conditioning
  including, that is, sandblasting, etching, and anodization. In addition, 192 zirconia
  specimens with the same dimensions as the titanium specimens but altered ...'
