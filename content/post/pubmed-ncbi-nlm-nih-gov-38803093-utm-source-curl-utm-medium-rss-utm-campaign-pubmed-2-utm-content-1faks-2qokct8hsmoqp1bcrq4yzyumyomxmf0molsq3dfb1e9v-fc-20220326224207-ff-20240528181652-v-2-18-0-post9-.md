description: Meso-octaalkylcalix[4]pyrrolates are a class of redox-active porphyrinogen
  ligands. They have been well established in d- and f-block chemistry for over three
  decades but have only recently been introduced as ligands for p-block elements.
  Here, we present a study on the influence of meso-substituents on the redox chemistry
  of calix[4]pyrrolato stannate(II) dianions [2R]2- (R = Me, Et). Expansion of the
  normal-mode structural decomposition (NSD) method, well known for porphyrin ...
