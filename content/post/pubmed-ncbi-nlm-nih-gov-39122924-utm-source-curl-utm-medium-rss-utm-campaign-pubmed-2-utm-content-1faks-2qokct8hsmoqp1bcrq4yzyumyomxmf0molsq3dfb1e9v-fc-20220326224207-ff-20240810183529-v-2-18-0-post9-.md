description: How the timing of development is linked to organismal size is a longstanding
  question. Although numerous studies have reported a correlation of temporal and
  spatial traits, the developmental or selective constraints underlying this link
  remain largely unexplored. We address this question by studying the periodic process
  of embryonic axis segmentation in-vivo in Oryzias fish. Interspecies comparisons
  reveal that the timing of segmentation correlates to segment, tissue and organismal
  size. ...
