description: Invasive infections with Aspergillus fumigatus in ICU patients are linked
  to high morbidity and mortality. Diagnosing invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA)
  in non-immunosuppressed patients is difficult, as Aspergillus antigen (galactomannan
  [GM]) may have other causes. This retrospective study analyzed 160 ICU surgical
  patients with positive GM in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF), classifying them
  based on AspICU criteria for suspected IPA (pIPA) or aspiration. Patients with pIPA
