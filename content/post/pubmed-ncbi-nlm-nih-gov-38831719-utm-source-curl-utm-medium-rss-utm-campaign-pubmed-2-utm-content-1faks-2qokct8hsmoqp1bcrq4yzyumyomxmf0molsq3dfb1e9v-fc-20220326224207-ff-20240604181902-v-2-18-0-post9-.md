description: Brain metastases (BM) constitute an increasing challenge in oncology
  due to their impact on neurological function, limited treatment options, and poor
  prognosis. BM occur through extravasation of circulating tumor cells across the
  blood-brain barrier. However, the extravasation processes are still poorly understood.
  We here propose a brain colonization process which mimics infarction-like microenvironmental
  reactions, that is dependent on Angiopoietin (Ang-2) and vascular endothelial ...
