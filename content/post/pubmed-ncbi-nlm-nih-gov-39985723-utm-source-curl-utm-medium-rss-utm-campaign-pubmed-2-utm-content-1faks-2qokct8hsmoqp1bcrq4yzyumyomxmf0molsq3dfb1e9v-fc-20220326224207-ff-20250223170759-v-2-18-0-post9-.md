description: Augmented reality (AR) is a new technique enabling interaction with three-dimensional
  (3D) holograms of cinematic rendering (CR) reconstructions. Research in this field
  is in its very early steps, and data is scarce. We evaluated image quality, usability,
  and potential applications of AR in cardiovascular image datasets. Ten CR reconstructions
  of cardiovascular computed tomography (CT) datasets with complex anatomical abnormalities
  were presented to six radiologists and three cardiologists ...
