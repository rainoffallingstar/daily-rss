description: During the transition from embryonic to adult life, the sites of hematopoiesis
  undergo dynamic shifts across various tissues. In adults, while bone marrow becomes
  the primary site for definitive hematopoiesis, the establishment of the bone marrow
  niche for accommodating hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) remains incompletely understood.
  Here, we reveal that perinatal bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) exhibit
  highly activated insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) signaling ...
