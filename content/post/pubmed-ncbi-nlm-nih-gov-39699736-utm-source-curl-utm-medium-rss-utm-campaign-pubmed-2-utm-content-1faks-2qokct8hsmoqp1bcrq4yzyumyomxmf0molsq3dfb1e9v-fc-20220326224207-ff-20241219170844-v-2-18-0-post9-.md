description: Functionalized lipid analogs are a versatile tool for studying lipid
  localization, metabolism and interactions in cells. As a common follow-up research,
  in vitro experiments are utilized to confirm specific interactors and characterize
  protein-lipid interactions. Here, we describe protocols that rely on commercially
  available photoactivatable and clickable lipids in reconstituted systems to capture
  protein-lipid interactions and detect lipid transport between purified ...
