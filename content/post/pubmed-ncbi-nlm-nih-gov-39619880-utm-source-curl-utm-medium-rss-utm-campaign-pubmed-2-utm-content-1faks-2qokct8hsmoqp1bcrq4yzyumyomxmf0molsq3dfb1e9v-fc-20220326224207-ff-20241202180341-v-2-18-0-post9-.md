description: MicroRNA profiling in human cartilage is necessary for chondrogenesis.
  The study aimed to compare microRNA 127-5p (miR-127-5p) and TGF-β signaling pathway
  gene expressions of human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAT-MSCs)
  and synovial fluid-derived stem cells (hSF-MSCs) after induced chondrogenesis. MSCs
  induced into chondrogenic differentiation. Alcian Blue and Safranin O staining were
  performed to determine chondrogenic differentiation. The RT-qPCR determined the
