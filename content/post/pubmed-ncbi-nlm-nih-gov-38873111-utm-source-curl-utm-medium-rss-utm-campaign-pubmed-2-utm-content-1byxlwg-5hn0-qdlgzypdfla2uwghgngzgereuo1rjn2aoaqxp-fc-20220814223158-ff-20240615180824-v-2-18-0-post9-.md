description: 'Introduction: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small and non-coding RNA molecules
  which have multiple important regulatory roles within cells. With the deepening
  research on miRNAs, more and more researches show that the abnormal expression of
  miRNAs is closely related to various diseases. The relationship between miRNAs and
  diseases is crucial for discovering the pathogenesis of diseases and exploring new
  treatment methods. Methods: Therefore, we propose a new sparse autoencoder and MLP
  method (SPALP) ...'
