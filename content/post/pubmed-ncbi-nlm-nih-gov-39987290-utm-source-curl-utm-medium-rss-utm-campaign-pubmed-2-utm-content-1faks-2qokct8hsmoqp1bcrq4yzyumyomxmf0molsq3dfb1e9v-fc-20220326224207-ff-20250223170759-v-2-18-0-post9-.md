description: Brain tumors are commonly treated with radiotherapy, but the efficacy
  of the treatment is limited by its toxicity to the normal tissue including post-irradiation
  contrast enhanced lesions often linked to necrosis. The poorly understood mechanisms
  behind such brain lesions were studied using cerebral organoids. Here we show that
  irradiation of such organoids leads to dose-dependent growth retardation and formation
  of liquid-filled cavities but is not correlated with necrosis. Instead, ...
