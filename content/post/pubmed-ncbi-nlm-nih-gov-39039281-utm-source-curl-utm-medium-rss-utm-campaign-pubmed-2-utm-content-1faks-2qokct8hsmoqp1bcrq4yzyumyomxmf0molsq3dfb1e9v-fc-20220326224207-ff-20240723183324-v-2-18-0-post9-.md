description: Individuals with ultrarare disorders pose a structural challenge for
  healthcare systems since expert clinical knowledge is required to establish diagnoses.
  In TRANSLATE NAMSE, a 3-year prospective study, we evaluated a novel diagnostic
  concept based on multidisciplinary expertise in Germany. Here we present the systematic
  investigation of the phenotypic and molecular genetic data of 1,577 patients who
  had undergone exome sequencing and were partially analyzed with next-generation
