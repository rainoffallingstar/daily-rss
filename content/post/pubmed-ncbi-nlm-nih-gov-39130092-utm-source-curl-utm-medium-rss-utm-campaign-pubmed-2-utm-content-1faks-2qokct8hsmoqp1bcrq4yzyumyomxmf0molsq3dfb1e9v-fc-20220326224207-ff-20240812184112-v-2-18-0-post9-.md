description: The multi-staged XENON program at INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran
  Sasso aims to detect dark matter with two-phase liquid xenon time projection chambers
  of increasing size and sensitivity. The XENONnT experiment is the latest detector
  in the program, planned to be an upgrade of its predecessor XENON1T. It features
  an active target of 5.9 tonnes of cryogenic liquid xenon (8.5 tonnes total mass
  in cryostat). The experiment is expected to extend the sensitivity to WIMP dark
  matter by more than ...
