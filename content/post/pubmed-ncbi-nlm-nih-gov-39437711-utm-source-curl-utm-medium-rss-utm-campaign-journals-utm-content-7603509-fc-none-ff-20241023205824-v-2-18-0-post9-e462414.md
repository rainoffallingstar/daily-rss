description: Although iron overload is a common feature in myelodysplastic syndromes
  (MDS), it remains unclear how iron excess is detrimental for disease pathophysiology.
  Taking advantage of complementary approaches, we analyzed the impact of iron overload
  and restriction achieved through genetic activation (FPNC326S) and pharmacologic
  inhibition (vamifeport) of the iron exporter ferroportin in a MDS mouse model, respectively.
  While FPNC326S-induced iron overload did not significantly improve the late ...
