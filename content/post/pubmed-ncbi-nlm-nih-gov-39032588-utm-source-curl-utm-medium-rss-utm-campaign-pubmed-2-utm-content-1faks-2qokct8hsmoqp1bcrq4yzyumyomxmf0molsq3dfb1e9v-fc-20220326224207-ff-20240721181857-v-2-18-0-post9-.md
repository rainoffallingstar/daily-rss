description: In patients with prevalent or incident atrial fibrillation (AF) after
  successful transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) enrolled in the ENVISAGE-TAVI
  AF trial, the incidence of ischemic stroke (IS) and any stroke was numerically lower
  in the edoxaban group vs. the vitamin K antagonist (VKA) group. The current study
  aimed to identify risk factors associated with IS in an on-treatment subanalysis
  of patients from ENVISAGE-TAVI AF who received ≥1 dose of edoxaban or VKA. Baseline
