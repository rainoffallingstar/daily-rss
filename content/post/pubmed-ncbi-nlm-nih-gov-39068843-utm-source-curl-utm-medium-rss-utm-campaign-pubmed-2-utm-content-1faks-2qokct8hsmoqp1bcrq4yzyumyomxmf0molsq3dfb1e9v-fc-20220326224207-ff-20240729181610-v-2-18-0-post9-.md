description: 'CONCLUSION: Outpatient hysteroscopy procedures are generally well tolerated.
  The pain experience with operative Myosure was less than that reported during the
  diagnostic hysteroscopy by the same patient although this is unlikely of clinical
  significance. Importantly, Myosure was not more painful than the initial diagnostic
  procedure, and most patients were satisfied with the outcome and would choose to
  have the procedure again in an outpatient setting. This is in keeping with other
  studies ...'
