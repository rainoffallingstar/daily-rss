description: MR elastography is a non-invasive imaging technique that provides quantitative
  maps of tissue biomechanical properties, i.e., elasticity and viscosity. Currently,
  hepatic MR elastography is deployed in the clinic to assess liver fibrosis in MAFLD
  patients. In addition, research has demonstrated MR elastography's ability to non-invasively
  assess chronic liver disease and to characterize breast cancer lesions and brain
  tumors. MR elastography requires efficient mechanical wave generation ...
