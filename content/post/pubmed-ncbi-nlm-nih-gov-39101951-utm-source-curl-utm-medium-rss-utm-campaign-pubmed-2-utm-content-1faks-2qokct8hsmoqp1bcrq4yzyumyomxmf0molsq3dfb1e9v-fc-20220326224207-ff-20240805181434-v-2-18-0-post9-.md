description: Outbreaks of emerging diseases, like Mpox in 2022, pose unprecedented
  challenges to global healthcare systems. Although Mpox cases globally decreased
  since the end of 2022, numbers are still significant in the African Region, European
  Region, Region of the Americas, and Western Pacific Region. Rapid and efficient
  detection of infected individuals by precise screening assays is crucial for successful
  containment. In these assays, analytical and clinical performance must be assessed
  to ensure ...
