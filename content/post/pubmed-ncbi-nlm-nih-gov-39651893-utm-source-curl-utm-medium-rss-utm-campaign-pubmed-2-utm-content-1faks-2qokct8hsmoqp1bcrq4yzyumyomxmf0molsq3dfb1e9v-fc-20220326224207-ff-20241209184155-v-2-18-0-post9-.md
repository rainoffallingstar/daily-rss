description: Eradication of cancer cells by the immune system requires extravasation,
  infiltration and progression of immune cells through the tumor extracellular matrix
  (ECM). These are also critical determinants for successful adoptive cell immunotherapy
  of solid tumors. Together with structural proteins, such as collagens and fibronectin,
  heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans are major components of the ECM. Heparanase 1
  (HPSE) is the only enzyme known to have endoglycosidase activity that degrades HS.
