  <p>rstudio::conf(2022), our main event for all things R and RStudio, ended in July. The workshop instructors, teaching assistants, speakers, and folks behind the scenes did a fantastic job delivering hours of incredible content over four days.</p>
  <p>The conference may be over, but all the talks and keynotes are now available on YouTube. We hope you catch up on a talk you may have missed, rewatch a keynote or two, or take the opportunity to learn about a new package.</p>
