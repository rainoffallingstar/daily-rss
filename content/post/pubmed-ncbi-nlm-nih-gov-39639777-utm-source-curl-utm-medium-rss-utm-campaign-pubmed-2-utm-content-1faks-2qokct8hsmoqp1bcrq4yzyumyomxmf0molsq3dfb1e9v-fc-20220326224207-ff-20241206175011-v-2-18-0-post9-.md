description: Lung MRI is an important tool in the assessment and monitoring of pediatric
  and neonatal lung disorders. MRI can provide both similar and complementary image
  contrast to computed tomography for imaging the lung macrostructure, and beyond
  this, a number of techniques have been developed for imaging the key functions of
  the lungs, namely ventilation, perfusion, and gas exchange, through the use of free-breathing
  proton and hyperpolarized gas MRI. Here, we review the state-of-the-art in MRI ...
