description: Tissue transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) and matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7)
  are suggested to be involved in cancer development and progression, however, their
  specific role in colon cancer remains elusive. The present study investigated whether
  TGM2 and MMP7 influence epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) processes of colon
  cancer cells. TGM2 was either overexpressed or knocked down in SW480 and HCT-116
  cells, and MMP7 expression and activity analyzed. Conversely, MMP7 was silenced
  and ...
