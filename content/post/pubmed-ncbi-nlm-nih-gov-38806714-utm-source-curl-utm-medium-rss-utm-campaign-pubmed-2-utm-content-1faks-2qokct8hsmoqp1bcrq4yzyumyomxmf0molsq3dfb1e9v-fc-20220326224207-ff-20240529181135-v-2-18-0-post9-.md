  (mSVs) in normal tissues is understudied. Utilizing Strand-seq, we sequenced 1,133
  single-cell genomes from 19 human donors of increasing age, and discovered the heterogeneous
  mSV landscapes of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. While mSVs are continuously
  acquired throughout life, expanded subclones in our cohort are confined to individuals
