description: Spatially resolved transcriptomics technologies potentially provide the
  extra spatial position information and tissue image to better infer spatial cell-cell
  interactions (CCIs) in processes such as tissue homeostasis, development, and disease
  progression. However, methods for effectively integrating spatial multimodal data
  to infer CCIs are still lacking. Here, the authors propose a deep learning method
  for integrating features through co-convolution, called SpaGraphCCI, to ...
