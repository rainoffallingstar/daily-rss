description: Stem cells perceive and respond to biochemical and physical signals to
  maintain homeostasis. Yet, it remains unclear how stem cells sense mechanical signals
  from their niche in vivo. In this work, we investigated the roles of PIEZO mechanosensitive
  channels in the intestinal stem cell (ISC) niche. We used mouse genetics and single-cell
  RNA sequencing analysis to assess the requirement for PIEZO channels in ISC maintenance.
  In vivo measurement of basement membrane stiffness showed that ...
