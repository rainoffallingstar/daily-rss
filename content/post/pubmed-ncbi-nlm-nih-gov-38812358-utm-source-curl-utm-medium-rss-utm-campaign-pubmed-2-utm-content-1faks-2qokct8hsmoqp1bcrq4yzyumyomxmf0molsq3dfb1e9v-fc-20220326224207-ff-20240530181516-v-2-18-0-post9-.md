description: Plants, being sessile organisms, constantly need to respond to environmental
  stresses, often leading to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). While
  ROS can be harmful, they also act as messengers guiding plant growth and stress
  responses. Because chloroplasts are sensitive to environmental changes and are both
  a source and target of ROS during stress conditions, they are important in conveying
  environmental changes to the nucleus, where acclimation responses are coordinated
