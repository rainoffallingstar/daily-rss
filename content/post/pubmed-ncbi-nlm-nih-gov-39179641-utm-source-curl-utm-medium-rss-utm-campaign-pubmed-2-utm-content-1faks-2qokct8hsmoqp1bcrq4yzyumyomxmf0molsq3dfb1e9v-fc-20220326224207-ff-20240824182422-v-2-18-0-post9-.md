description: For photo-dissociation of a single hydrogen molecule ( H 2 ) with combined
  XUV and IR laser pulses, we demonstrate optical control of the emission direction
  of the photoelectron with respect to the outgoing neutral fragment (the H-atom).
  Depending on the relative delay between the two laser fields, adjustable with sub-femtosecond
  time resolution, the photoelectron is emitted into the same hemisphere as the H-atom
  or opposite. This emission asymmetry is a result of entanglement of ...
