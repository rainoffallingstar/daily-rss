description: Ebstein anomaly (EA) is a rare, congenital cardiac defect of the tricuspid
  valve with a birth prevalence between 0.5 and 1 in 20,000 [1]. It is characterized
  by displacement of the tricuspid valve toward the apex of the right ventricle (RV)
  and "atrialization" of the RV (Fig. 57.1) [2]. EA accounts for about 0.5% of all
  congenital heart diseases (CHD) [2]. Depending on severity of the defect and due
  to heterogeneity of the disease, patient's presentation varies from severe heart
