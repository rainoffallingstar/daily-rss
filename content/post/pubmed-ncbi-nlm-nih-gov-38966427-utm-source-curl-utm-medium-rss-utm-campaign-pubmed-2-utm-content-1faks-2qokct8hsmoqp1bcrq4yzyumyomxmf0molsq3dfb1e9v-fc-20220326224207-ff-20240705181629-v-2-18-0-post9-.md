description: Familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neuromuscular
  disorder that is due to mutations in one of several target genes, including SOD1.
  So far, clinical records, rodent studies, and in vitro models have yielded arguments
  for either a primary motor neuron disease, or a pleiotropic pathogenesis of ALS.
  While mouse models lack the human origin, in vitro models using human induced pluripotent
  stem cells (hiPSC) have been recently developed for addressing ALS pathogenesis.
