description: With the aim to advance the understanding of immune regulation in MCL
  and to identify targetable T-cell subsets, we set out to combine image analysis
  and spatial omic technology focused on both early and late differentiation stages
  of T cells. MCL patient tissue (n = 102) was explored using image analysis and GeoMx
  spatial omics profiling of 69 proteins and 1812 mRNAs. Tumor cells, T helper (T(H))
  cells and cytotoxic (T(C)) cells of early (CD57-) and late (CD57+) differentiation
  stage ...
