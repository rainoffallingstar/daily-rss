description: Carcinogenesis encompasses processes that lead to increased mutation
  rates, enhanced cellular division (tumour growth), and invasive growth. Colorectal
  cancer (CRC) carcinogenesis in carriers of pathogenic APC (path_APC) and pathogenic
  mismatch repair gene (path_MMR) variants is initiated by a second hit affecting
  the corresponding wild-type allele. In path_APC carriers, second hits result in
  the development of multiple adenomas, with CRC typically emerging after an additional
  20 years. ...
