description: Deuterated ("heavy") water labeling in CLL patients demonstrates that
  IGHV unmutated and ZAP-70-positive patients have higher blood and tissue CLL death
  rates on ibrutinib therapy, resulting in lower measurable residual disease (MRD)
  levels with long-term ibrutinib treatment. ...
