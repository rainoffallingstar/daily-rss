description: It is acknowledged that conventional renal cell carcinoma (cRCC), which
  makes up 85% of renal malignancies, is a highly vascular tumor. Humanized monoclonal
  antibodies were developed to inhibit tumor neo-angiogenesis, which is driven by
  VEGFA/KDR signaling. The results largely met our expectations, and in several cases,
  adverse events occurred. Our study aimed to analyze the expression of VEGFA and
  its receptor KDR by immunohistochemistry in tissue multi-array containing 811 cRCC
  and find ...
