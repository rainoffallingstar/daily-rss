description: MBL is a precursor condition to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), characterized
  by monoclonal B-cells in blood. Mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) are a form
  of clonal hematopoiesis that include gains, losses, and copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity
  of large DNA segments. Both MBL and mCAs have been found to increase the risk of
  CLL and lymphoid malignancies, and the aim of our study was to investigate how mCAs
  relate to MBL, which is currently unknown. We analyzed genetic, flow ...
