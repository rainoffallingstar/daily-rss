description: In classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), responsiveness to immune-checkpoint
  blockade (ICB) is associated with specific tumor microenvironment (TME) and peripheral
  blood features. The role of ICB in nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma
  (NLPHL) is not established. To gain insights into its potential in NLPHL, we compared
  TME and peripheral blood signatures between HLs using an integrative multiomic analysis.
  A discovery/validation approach in 121 NLPHL and 114 cHL patients ...
