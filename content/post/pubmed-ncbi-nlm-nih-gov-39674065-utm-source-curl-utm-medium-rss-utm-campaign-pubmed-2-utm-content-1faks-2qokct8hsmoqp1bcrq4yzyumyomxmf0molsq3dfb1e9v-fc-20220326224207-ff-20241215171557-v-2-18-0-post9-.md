description: 'BACKGROUND: The assessment of gait disorders in patients with neuromotor
  conditions, such as cerebral palsy (CP), has been a focus of clinical and research
  attention, with electromyography (EMG) offering a nuanced understanding of neurological
  and neuromuscular disorders. However, the interpretation of EMG data in the context
  of gait analysis remains challenging due to the complexity of neuromotor dynamics
  and variability in assessment ...'
