description: This Letter presents the first study of the energy dependence of diboson
  polarization fractions in WZ→ℓνℓ^{'}ℓ^{'}(ℓ,ℓ^{'}=e,μ) production. The dataset used
  corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb^{-1} of proton-proton collisions
  at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector. Two fiducial
  regions with an enhanced presence of events featuring two longitudinally polarized
  bosons are defined. A nonzero fraction of events with two longitudinally polarized
  bosons ...
