description: Iron is an essential nutrient and a constituent of ferroproteins and
  enzymes crucial for human life. Generally, nonmenstruating individuals preserve
  iron very efficiently, losing less than 0.1% of their body iron content each day,
  an amount that is replaced through dietary iron absorption. Most of the iron is
  in the hemoglobin (Hb) of red blood cells (RBCs); thus, blood loss is the most common
  cause of acute iron depletion and anemia worldwide, and reduced hemoglobin synthesis
  and anemia are ...
