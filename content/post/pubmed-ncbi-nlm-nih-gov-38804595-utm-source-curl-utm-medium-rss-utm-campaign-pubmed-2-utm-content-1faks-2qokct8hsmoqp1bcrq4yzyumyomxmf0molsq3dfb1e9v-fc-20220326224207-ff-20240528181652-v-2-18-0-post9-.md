description: Polymer mechanochemistry utilizes mechanical force to activate latent
  functionalities in macromolecules and widely relies on ultrasonication techniques.
  Fundamental constraints of frequency and power intensity have prohibited the application
  of the polymer mechanochemistry principles in a biomedical context up to now, although
