description: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a crucial role in gene regulation and have
  been implicated in the development of drug resistance in cancer, representing a
  significant challenge in oncological therapeutics. Despite advancements in computational
  models predicting RNA-drug interactions, existing frameworks often overlook the
  complex interplay between circRNAs, drug mechanisms, and disease contexts. This
  study aims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel computational model, circRDRP,
