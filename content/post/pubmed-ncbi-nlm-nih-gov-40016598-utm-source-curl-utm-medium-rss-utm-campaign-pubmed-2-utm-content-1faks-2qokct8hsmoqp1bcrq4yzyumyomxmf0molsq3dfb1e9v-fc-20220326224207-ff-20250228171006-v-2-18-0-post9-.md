description: The spliceosome, a highly dynamic macromolecular assembly, catalyzes
  the precise removal of introns from pre-mRNAs. Recent studies have provided comprehensive
  structural insights into the step-wise assembly, catalytic splicing and final disassembly
  of the spliceosome. However, the molecular details of how the spliceosome recognizes
  and rejects suboptimal splicing substrates remained unclear. Here, we show cryo-electron
  microscopy structures of spliceosomal quality control complexes from ...
