description: Angular correlations between heavy quarks provide a unique probe of the
  quark-gluon plasma created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Results are
  presented of a measurement of the azimuthal angle correlations between muons originating
  from semileptonic decays of heavy quarks produced in 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb and pp collisions
  at the LHC. The muons are measured with transverse momenta and pseudorapidities
  satisfying p_{T}^{μ}>4 GeV and |η^{μ}|<2.4, respectively. The distributions of ...
