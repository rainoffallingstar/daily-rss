description: Triphenylamine (TPA) and N-heterotriangulene (N-HTA) scaffolds with up
  to three oligophenyl extensions are investigated by electrospray ionization (tandem)
  mass spectrometry (ESI-[MS/]MS). Due to their low oxidation potentials, all molecules
  readily form radical cations in the electrospray process. The energy-resolved collision-induced
  dissociation behaviour of the molecular ions is contrasted to that of the silver(I)
  adducts. Complexation with Ag(I) leads to the expected [1:1] and ...
