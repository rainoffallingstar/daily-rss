description: Dynein is the primary molecular motor responsible for retrograde intracellular
  transport of a variety of cargoes, performing successive nanometer-sized steps within
  milliseconds. Due to the limited spatiotemporal precision of established methods
  for molecular tracking, current knowledge of dynein stepping is essentially limited
  to slowed-down measurements in vitro. Here, we use MINFLUX fluorophore localization
  to directly track CRISPR/Cas9-tagged endogenous dynein with nanometer/millisecond...
