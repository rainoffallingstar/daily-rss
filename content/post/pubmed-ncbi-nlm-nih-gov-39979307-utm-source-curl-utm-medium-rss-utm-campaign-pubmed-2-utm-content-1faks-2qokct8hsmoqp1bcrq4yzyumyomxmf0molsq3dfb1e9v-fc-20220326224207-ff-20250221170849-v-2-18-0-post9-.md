description: We have recently developed a machine learning classifier that enables
  fast, accurate, and affordable classification of brain tumors based on genome-wide
  DNA methylation profiles that is widely employed in the clinic. Neuro-oncology research
  would benefit greatly from understanding the underlying artificial intelligence
  decision process, which currently remains unclear. Here, we describe an interpretable
  framework to explain the classifier's decisions. We show that functional genomic
