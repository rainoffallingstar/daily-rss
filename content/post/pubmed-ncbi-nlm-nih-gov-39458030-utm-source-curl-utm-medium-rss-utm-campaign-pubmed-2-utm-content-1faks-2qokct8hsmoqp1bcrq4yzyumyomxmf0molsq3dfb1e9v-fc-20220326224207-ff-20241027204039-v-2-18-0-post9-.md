description: 'Background: The KDM1A histone demethylase regulates the cellular balance
  between proliferation and differentiation, and is often deregulated in human cancers
  including the childhood tumor neuroblastoma. We previously showed that KDM1A is
  strongly expressed in undifferentiated neuroblastomas and correlates with poor patient
  prognosis, suggesting a possible clinical benefit from targeting KDM1A. Methods:
  Here, we tested the efficacy of NCL-1, a small molecule specifically inhibiting
  KDM1A ...'
