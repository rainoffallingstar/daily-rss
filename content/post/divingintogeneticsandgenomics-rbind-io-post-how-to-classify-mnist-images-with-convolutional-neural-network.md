  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>An artificial intelligence system called a convolutional neural network (CNN) has gained a lot of popularity recently. For jobs like image recognition, where we want to teach a computer to recognize things in a picture, they are especially well suited.</p>
  <p>CNNs operate by dissecting an image into increasingly minute components, or “features.” The network then examines each feature and searches for patterns shared ...
