description: Due to their high developmental diversity and different regulatory and
  functional roles, B cell subpopulations can promote or inhibit tumor growth. An
  orthotopic murine HNSCC model was applied to investigate the B cell composition
  and function in HNSCCs. Using flow cytometry approaches, cells from the spleen,
  lymph nodes and tumors were analyzed. Additionally, immunoglobulin (Ig) levels post-tumor
  induction were tracked via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Following
