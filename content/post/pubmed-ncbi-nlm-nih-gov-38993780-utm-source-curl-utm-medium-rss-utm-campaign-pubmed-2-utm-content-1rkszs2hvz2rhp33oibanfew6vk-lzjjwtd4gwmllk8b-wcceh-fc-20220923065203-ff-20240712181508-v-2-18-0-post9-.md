description: Invariant Natural Killer T cell therapy is an emerging platform of immunotherapy
  for cancer treatment. This unique cell population is a promising candidate for cell
  therapy for cancer treatment because of its inherent cytotoxicity against CD1d positive
  cancers as well as its ability to induce host CD8 T cell cross priming. Substantial
  evidence supports that iNKT cells can modulate myelomonocytic populations in the
  tumor microenvironment to ameliorate immune dysregulation to antagonize ...
