description: Outcomes are poor in triple-class-exposed (TCE) relapsed/refractory multiple
  myeloma (RRMM). In the phase 3 KarMMa-3 (clinicaltrials.gov; NCT03651128) trial,
  patients with TCE RRMM and 2-4 prior regimens were randomized 2:1 to idecabtagene
  vicleucel (ide-cel) or standard regimens (SRs). An interim analysis (IA) demonstrated
  significantly longer median progression-free survival (PFS; primary endpoint; 13.3
  vs 4.4 months; P<.0001) and higher overall response rate (ORR) with ide-cel vs SRs.
