description: It is well established that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) exerts
  top-down control of many behaviors, but little is known regarding how cross-talk
  between distinct areas of the mPFC influences top-down signaling. We performed virus-mediated
  tracing and functional studies in male mice, homing in on GABAergic projections
  whose axons are located mainly in layer 1 and that connect two areas of the mPFC,
  namely the prelimbic area (PrL) with the cingulate area 1 and 2 (Cg1/2). We revealed
