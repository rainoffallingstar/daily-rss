description: The rapid development of deep learning has revolutionized medical image
  processing, including analyzing whole slide images (WSIs). Despite the demonstrated
  potential for characterizing gene mutations directly from WSIs in certain cancers,
  challenges remain due to image resolution and reliance on manual annotations for
  acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We, therefore, propose a deep learning model based
  on multiple instance learning (MIL) with ensemble techniques to predict gene mutations
