description: The rat protoparvovirus H-1 (H-1PV) is an oncolytic virus known for its
  anticancer properties in laboratory models of various human tumors, including non-Hodgkin
  lymphomas (NHL) of B-cell origin. However, H-1PV therapeutic potential against hematological
  malignancies of T-cell origin remains underexplored. The aim of the present study
  was to conduct a pilot preclinical investigation of H-1PV-mediated oncolytic effects
  in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), a type of NHL that is urgently ...
