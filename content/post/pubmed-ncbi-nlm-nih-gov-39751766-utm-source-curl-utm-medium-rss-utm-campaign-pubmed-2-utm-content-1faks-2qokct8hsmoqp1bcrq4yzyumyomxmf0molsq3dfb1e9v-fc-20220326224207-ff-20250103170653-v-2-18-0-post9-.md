  strategies are essential for optimizing colorectal cancer (CRC) screening offers,
  but such studies are lacking in Germany, where two screening colonoscopies (CS)
  10 years apart are offered for men from age 50 and women from age 55. Our aim was
  to explore whether and to what extent the efficacy of utilizing two CS could be
  enhanced by alternative starting ages and screening intervals. We modeled the expected
