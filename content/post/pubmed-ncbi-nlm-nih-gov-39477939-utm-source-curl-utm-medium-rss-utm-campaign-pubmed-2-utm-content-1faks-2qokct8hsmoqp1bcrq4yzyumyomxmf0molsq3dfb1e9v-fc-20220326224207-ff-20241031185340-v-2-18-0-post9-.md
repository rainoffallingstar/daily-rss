description: The generation of antibody-drug conjugates with optimal functionality
  depends on many parameters. These include binder epitope, antibody format, linker
  composition, conjugation site(s), drug-to-antibody ratio, and conjugation method.
  The production of matrices that cover all possible parameters is a major challenge
  in identifying optimal antibody-drug conjugates. To address this bottleneck, we
  adapted our Format Chain Exchange technology (FORCE), originally established for
