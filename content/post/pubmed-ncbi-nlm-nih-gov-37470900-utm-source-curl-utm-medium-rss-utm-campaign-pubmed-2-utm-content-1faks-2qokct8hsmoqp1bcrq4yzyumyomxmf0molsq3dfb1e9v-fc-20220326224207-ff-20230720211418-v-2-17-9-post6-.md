description: Standard response formats such as rating or visual analogue scales require
  respondents to condense distributions of latent states or behaviors into a single
  value. Whereas this is suitable to measure central tendency, it neglects the variance
  of distributions. As a remedy, variability may be measured using interval-response
  formats, more specifically the dual-range slider (RS2). Given the lack of an appropriate
  item response model for the RS2, we develop the Dirichlet dual response model ...
