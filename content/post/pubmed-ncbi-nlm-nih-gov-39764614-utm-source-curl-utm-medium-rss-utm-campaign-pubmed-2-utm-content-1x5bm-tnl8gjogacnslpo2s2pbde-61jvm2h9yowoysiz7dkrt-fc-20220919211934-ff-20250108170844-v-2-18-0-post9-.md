description: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies enable dissecting the tissue
  architecture in spatial context. To perceive the global contextual information of
  gene expression patterns in tissue, the spatial dependence of cells must be fully
  considered by integrating both local and non-local features by means of spatial-context-aware.
  However, the current ST integration algorithm ignores for ST dropouts, which impedes
  the spatial-aware of ST features, resulting in challenges in the accuracy ...
