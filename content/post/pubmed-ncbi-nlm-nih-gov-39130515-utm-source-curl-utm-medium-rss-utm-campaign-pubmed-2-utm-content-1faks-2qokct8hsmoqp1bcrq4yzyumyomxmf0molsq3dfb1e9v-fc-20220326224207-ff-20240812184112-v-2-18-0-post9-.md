description: Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly,
  prompting extensive efforts to pinpoint novel therapeutic targets for effective
  intervention. Among the hallmark features of Alzheimer's disease is the development
  of neurofibrillary tangles comprised of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, whose progressive
  spread throughout the brain is associated with neuronal death. Trans-synaptic propagation
  of tau has been observed in mouse models, and indirect evidence for tau spread ...
