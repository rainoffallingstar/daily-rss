description: Group 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) encompass NK cells and ILC1s, which
  have non-redundant roles in host protection against pathogens and cancer. Despite
  their circulating nature, NK cells can establish residency in selected tissues during
  ontogeny, forming a distinct functional subset. The mechanisms that initiate, maintain,
  and regulate the conversion of NK cells into tissue-resident NK (trNK) cells are
  currently not well understood. Here, we identify autocrine transforming growth ...
