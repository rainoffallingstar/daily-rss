description: Thromboembolic events are common in patients with essential thrombocythemia
  (ET). However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the increased thrombotic
  risk remain to be determined. Here, we perform the first phenotypical characterization
  of platelet expression using single-cell mass cytometry in six ET patients and six
  age- and sex-matched healthy individuals. A large panel of 18 transmembrane regulators
  of platelet function and activation were analyzed, at baseline and after ...
