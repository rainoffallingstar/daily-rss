description: Glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1) is a rare inherited metabolic disease
  increasingly included in newborn screening (NBS) programs worldwide. Because of
  the broad biochemical spectrum of individuals with GA1 and the lack of reliable
  second-tier strategies, NBS for GA1 is still confronted with a high rate of false
  positives. In this study, we aim to increase the specificity of NBS for GA1 and,
  hence, to reduce the rate of false positives through machine learning methods. Therefore,
  we studied ...
