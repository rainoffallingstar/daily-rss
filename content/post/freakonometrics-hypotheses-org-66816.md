description: 'Our paper, Alternative fixed-effects panel model using weighted asymmetric
  least squares regression, with Amadou and Karim, is now published by Statistical
  Methods &#38; Applications. A fixed-effects model estimates the regressor effects
  on the mean of the response, which is inadequate to account for heteroscedasticity.
  In this paper, we adapt the asymmetric least squares (expectile) regression to the
  fixed-effects panel model and propose a new model: expectile regression with fixed
  effects (ERFE). The ERFE model applies the within transformation strategy to solve
  the incidental parameter ...'
