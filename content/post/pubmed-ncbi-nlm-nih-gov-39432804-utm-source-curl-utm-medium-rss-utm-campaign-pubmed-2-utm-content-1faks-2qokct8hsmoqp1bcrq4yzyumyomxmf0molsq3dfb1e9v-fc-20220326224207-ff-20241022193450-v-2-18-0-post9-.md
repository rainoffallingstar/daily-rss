description: Neuropathic pain remains difficult to treat, with drug development hampered
  by an incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis of the condition, as well as
  a lack of biomarkers. The problem is compounded by the scarcity of relevant human
  peripheral tissues, including skin, nerves, and dorsal root ganglia. Efforts to
  obtain such samples are accelerating, increasing the need for standardisation across
