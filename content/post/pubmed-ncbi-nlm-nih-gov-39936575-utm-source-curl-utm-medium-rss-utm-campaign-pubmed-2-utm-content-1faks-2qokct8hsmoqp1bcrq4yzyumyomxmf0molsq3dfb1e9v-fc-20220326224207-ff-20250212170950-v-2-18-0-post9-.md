description: Recent breakthroughs in AI-mediated protein structure prediction have
  significantly accelerated research and generated valuable hypotheses within the
  field of structural biology and beyond. Notably, AlphaFold2 has facilitated the
  determination of larger protein complexes for which only limited experimental data
  are available. De novo predictions can now be experimentally validated with relative
  ease compared to the pre-AlphaFold2 era. In May 2024, AlphaFold3 was launched with
