description: Recent observations have found a large number of supermassive black holes
  already in place in the first few hundred million years after the Big Bang, many
  of which seem to be overmassive relative to their host galaxy stellar mass when
  compared with local relation^(1-9). Several different models have been proposed
  to explain these findings, ranging from heavy seeds to light seeds experiencing
  bursts of high accretion rate^(10-16). Yet, current datasets are unable to differentiate
