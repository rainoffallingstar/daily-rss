description: Using nanopore sequencing, we showed feasibility and impact of rapid
  genomic screening for managing thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) in 18 prospective
  cases, achieving diagnoses in less than three days. We compared results to standard
  exome sequencing, cost-efficiency and complement blockade ...
