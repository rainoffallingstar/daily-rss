description: While it is important to find the key biomarkers and improve the accuracy
  of disease models, it is equally important to understand their interaction relationships.
  In this study, a transparent sparse graph pathway network (TSGPN) is proposed based
  on the structure of graph neural networks. This network simulates the action of
  genes in vivo, adds to prior knowledge, and improves the model's accuracy. First,
  the graph connection was constructed according to protein-protein interaction networks
