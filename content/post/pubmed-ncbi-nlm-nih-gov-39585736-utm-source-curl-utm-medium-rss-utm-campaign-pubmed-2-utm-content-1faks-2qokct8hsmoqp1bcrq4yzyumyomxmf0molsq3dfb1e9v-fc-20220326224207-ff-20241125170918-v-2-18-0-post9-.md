description: Sound location coding has been extensively studied at the central nucleus
  of the mammalian inferior colliculus (CNIC), supporting a population code. However,
  this population code has not been extensively characterized on the single-trial
  level with simultaneous recordings or at other anatomical regions like the dorsal
  cortex of inferior colliculus (DCIC), which is relevant for learning-induced experience
  dependent plasticity. To address these knowledge gaps, here we made in two ...
