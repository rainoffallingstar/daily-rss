description: 'CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest temporally controlled redundancy in
  IRP activities, with IRP2 mediating regulation of IRE-containing transcripts in
  the light phase and redundancy, conceivably with IRP1, at dark onset. Moreover,
  we highlight the significance of feeding-associated signals in driving rhythmicity.
  Our work highlights the dynamic nature and regulatory complexity in a metabolic
  pathway that had previously been considered ...'
