description: We evaluated the prognostic and therapeutic significance of measurable
  residual disease (MRD) during remission induction in pediatric acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia (ALL) patients. In the CCCG-ALL-2015 protocol, 7640 patients were categorized
  into low-, intermediate-, or high-risk groups based on clinical and genetic features.
  Final risk classification was determined by MRD assessed via flow cytometry on Days
  19 and 46 of remission induction, with additional intensified chemotherapy for Day
  19 ...
