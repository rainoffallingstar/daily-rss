description: Computational representations of knowledge graphs are critical for several
  tasks in bioinformatics, including large-scale graph analysis and gene function
  characterization. In this study, we introduce gGN, an unsupervised neural network
  for learning node representations as Gaussian distributions. Unlike prior efforts,
  where the covariance matrices of these distributions are simplified to diagonal,
  we propose representing them with a low-rank approximation. This representation
