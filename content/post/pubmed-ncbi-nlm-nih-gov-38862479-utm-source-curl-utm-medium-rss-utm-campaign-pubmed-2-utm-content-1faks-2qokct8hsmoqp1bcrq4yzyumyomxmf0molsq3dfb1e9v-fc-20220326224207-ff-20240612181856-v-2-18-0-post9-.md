description: Impairment of the central nervous system (CNS) poses a significant health
  risk for astronauts during long-duration space missions. In this study, we employed
  an innovative approach by integrating single-cell multiomics (transcriptomics and
  chromatin accessibility) with spatial transcriptomics to elucidate the impact of
  spaceflight on the mouse brain in female mice. Our comparative analysis between
  ground control and spaceflight-exposed animals revealed significant alterations
  in essential ...
