description: PARP inhibitors (PARPi) are used as a first-line treatment option for
  cancers with BRCA1/2 mutations, yet a significant number of patients show a limited
  response to these agents. In the present study, Lei and colleagues demonstrate that
  PARPi promote increased ferroptosis sensitivity and this can be exploited therapeutically
  to improve the response to PARPi, marking an important therapeutic concept to exploit
  ferroptosis-based strategies in clinical settings. See related article by Lei et
