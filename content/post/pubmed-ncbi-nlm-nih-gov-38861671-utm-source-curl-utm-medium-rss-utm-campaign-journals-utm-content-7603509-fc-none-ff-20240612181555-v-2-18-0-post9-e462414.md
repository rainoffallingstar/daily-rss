description: Ferroportin (Fpn) is the only iron exporter, playing a crucial role in
  systemic iron homeostasis. Fpn is negatively regulated by its ligand hepcidin, but
  other potential regulators in physiological and disease conditions remain poorly
  understood. Diabetes is a metabolic disorder that develops body iron loading with
  unknown mechanisms. By utilizing diabetic mouse models and human duodenal specimens,
  we demonstrated that intestinal Fpn expression was increased in diabetes in a hepcidin-independent...
