  transform them into a largely standardized output to their target cells-the action
  potential. A simplified model posits that synaptic signals are integrated by linear
  summation and passive propagation towards the axon initial segment, where the threshold
  for spike generation is either crossed or not. However, multiple lines of research
  during past decades have shown that signal integration in individual neurons is
