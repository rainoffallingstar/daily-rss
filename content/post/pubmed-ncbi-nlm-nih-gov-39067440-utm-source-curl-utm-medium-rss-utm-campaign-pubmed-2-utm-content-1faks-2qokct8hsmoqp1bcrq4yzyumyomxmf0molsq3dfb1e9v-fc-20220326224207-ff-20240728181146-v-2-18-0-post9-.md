description: Casein kinase-2 (CK2) are serine/threonine kinases with dual co-factor
  (ATP and GTP) specificity, that are involved in the regulation of a wide variety
  of cellular functions. Small molecules targeting CK2 have been described in the
  literature targeting different binding pockets of the kinase with a focus on type
  I inhibitors such as the recently published chemical probe SGC-CK2-1. In this study,
  we investigated whether known allosteric inhibitors binding to a pocket adjacent
  to helix αD could ...
