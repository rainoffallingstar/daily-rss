description: Chronic back pain (CBP) is a global health concern with significant societal
  and economic burden. While various predictors of back pain chronicity have been
  proposed, including demographic and psychosocial factors, neuroimaging studies have
  pointed to brain characteristics as predictors of CBP. However, large-scale, multisite
  validation of these predictors is currently lacking. In two independent longitudinal
