description: We experimentally study the influence of the binding energy on nondipole
  effects in K-shell single-photon ionization of atoms at high photon energies. We
  find that for each ionization event, as expected by momentum conservation, the photon
  momentum is transferred almost fully to the recoiling ion. The momentum distribution
  of the electrons becomes asymmetrically deformed along the photon propagation direction
  with a mean value of 8/(5c)(E_{γ}-I_{P}) confirming an almost 100 year old ...
