description: The characteristics of data produced by omics technologies are pivotal,
  as they critically influence the feasibility and effectiveness of computational
  methods applied in downstream analyses, such as data harmonization and differential
  abundance analyses. Furthermore, variability in these data characteristics across
  datasets plays a crucial role, leading to diverging outcomes in benchmarking studies,
  which are essential for guiding the selection of appropriate analysis methods in
