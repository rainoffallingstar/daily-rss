description: The effect of prior inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO) treatment on brexucabtagene
  autoleucel (brexu-cel) outcomes remains unclear in adults with acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia (ALL), particularly the influence off previous InO response and the timing
  of administration. We conducted a retrospective multicenter analysis of 189 patients
  with relapsed/refractory (r/r) ALL treated with brexu-cel. Over half of the patients
  received InO before brexu-cel (InO-exposed). InO-exposed patients were more ...
