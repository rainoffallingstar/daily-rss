description: Spastic paraplegia 47 (SPG47) is a neurological disorder caused by mutations
  in the adaptor protein complex 4 β1 subunit (AP4B1) gene leading to AP-4 complex
  deficiency. SPG47 is characterised by progressive spastic paraplegia, global developmental
  delay, intellectual disability and epilepsy. Gene therapy aimed at restoring functional
  AP4B1 protein levels is a rational therapeutic strategy to ameliorate the disease
  phenotype. Here we report that a single delivery of adeno-associated ...
