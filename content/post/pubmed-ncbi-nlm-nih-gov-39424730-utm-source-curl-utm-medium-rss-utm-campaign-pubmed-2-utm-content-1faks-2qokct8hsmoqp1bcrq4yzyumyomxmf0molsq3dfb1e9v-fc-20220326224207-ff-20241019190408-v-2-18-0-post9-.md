description: Cellular fate is regulated by intricate signal transduction mediated
  by posttranslational protein modifications like phosphorylation to transmit information.
  As other cancer types, lymphomas frequently show dysregulation of signaling pathways
  that contribute to malignant transformation and tumor progression. For example,
  in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma the B-cell antigen receptor was identified as an
  oncogenic driver mediating cellular growth and survival signals. Thus, the elucidation
  of ...
