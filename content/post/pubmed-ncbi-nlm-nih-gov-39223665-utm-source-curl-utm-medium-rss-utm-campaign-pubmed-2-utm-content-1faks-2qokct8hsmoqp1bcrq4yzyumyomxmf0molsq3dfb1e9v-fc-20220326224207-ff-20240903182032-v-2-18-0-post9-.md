description: BRAF serves as a gatekeeper of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, which plays
  a crucial role in homeostasis. Since aberrant signalling of this axis contributes
  to cancer and other diseases, it is tightly regulated by crosstalk with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway and ERK mediated feedback loops. For example, ERK limits BRAF signalling
  through phosphorylation of multiple residues. One of these, T401, is widely considered
  as an ERK substrate following acute pathway activation by growth factors. Here,
