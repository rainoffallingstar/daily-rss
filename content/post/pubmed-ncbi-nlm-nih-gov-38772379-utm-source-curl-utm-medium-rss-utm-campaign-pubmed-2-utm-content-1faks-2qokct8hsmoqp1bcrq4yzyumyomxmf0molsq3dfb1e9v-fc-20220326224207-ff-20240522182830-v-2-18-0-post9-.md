description: Utilizing trio whole-exome sequencing and a gene matching approach, we
  identified a cohort of 18 male individuals from 17 families with hemizygous variants
  in KCND1, including two de novo missense variants, three maternally inherited protein-truncating
  variants, and 12 maternally inherited missense variants. Affected subjects present
  with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by diverse neurological abnormalities,
  mostly delays in different developmental domains, but also ...
