description: Quantitative immuneprecipitation mass-spectrometry (QIP-MS) allows the
  identification of the M-protein in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) otherwise
  in complete response, and could be considered suitable for measurable residual disease
  (MRD) evaluation in peripheral blood. In the context of the GEM2012MENOS65 and GEM2014MAIN
  trials, we compared the performance of QIP-MS in serum with next-generation flow
  (NGF) cytometry in bone marrow to assess MRD in paired samples obtained ...
