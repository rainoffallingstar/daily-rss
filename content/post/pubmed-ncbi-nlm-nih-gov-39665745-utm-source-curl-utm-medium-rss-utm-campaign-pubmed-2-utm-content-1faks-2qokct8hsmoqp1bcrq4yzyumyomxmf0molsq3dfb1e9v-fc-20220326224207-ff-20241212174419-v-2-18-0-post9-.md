description: The current "consensus" order in which amino acids were added to the
  genetic code is based on potentially biased criteria, such as the absence of sulfur-containing
  amino acids from the Urey-Miller experiment which lacked sulfur. More broadly, abiotic
  abundance might not reflect biotic abundance in the organisms in which the genetic
  code evolved. Here, we instead identify which protein domains date to the last universal
  common ancestor (LUCA) and then infer the order of recruitment ...
