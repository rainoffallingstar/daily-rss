  not always spatially overlap with biological tumor volumes (BTV) measured by [^(18)F]Fluoroethyltyrosine
  positron emission tomography ([^(18)F]FET PET). We prospectively investigated volumetric
  patterns based on the extent of tumor volume overlap between the two modalities.
  Eighty-six patients with newly diagnosed glioma who had undergone MRI and [^(18)F]FET
