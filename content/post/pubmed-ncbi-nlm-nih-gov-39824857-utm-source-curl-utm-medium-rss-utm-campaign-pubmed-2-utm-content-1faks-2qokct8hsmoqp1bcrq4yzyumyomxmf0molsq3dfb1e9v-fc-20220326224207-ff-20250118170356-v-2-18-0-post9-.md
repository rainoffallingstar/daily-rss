description: Accurate melanoma diagnosis is crucial for patient outcomes and reliability
  of AI diagnostic tools. We assess interrater variability among eight expert pathologists
  reviewing histopathological images and clinical metadata of 792 melanoma-suspicious
  lesions prospectively collected at eight German hospitals. Moreover, we provide
  access to the largest panel-validated dataset featuring dermoscopic and histopathological
  images with metadata. Complete agreement is achieved in 53.5% of cases ...
