description: The high throughput analysis of proteins with mass spectrometry (MS)
  is highly valuable for understanding human biology, discovering disease biomarkers,
  identifying therapeutic targets, and exploring pathogen interactions. To achieve
  these goals, specialized proteomics subfields, including plasma proteomics, immunopeptidomics,
  and metaproteomics, must tackle specific analytical challenges, such as an increased
  identification ambiguity compared to routine proteomics experiments. ...
