description: The Four Core Genotypes (FCG) is a mouse model system used to disentangle
  the function of sex chromosomes and hormones. We report that a copy of a 3.2 MB
  region of the X chromosome has translocated to the Y^(Sry-) chromosome and thus
  increased the expression of X-linked genes including the single-stranded RNA sensor
  and autoimmune disease mediator Tlr7. This previously-unreported X-Y translocation
  complicates the interpretation of studies reliant on C57BL/6J FCG ...
