  tool for computer-based image analysis in radiology. Traditionally, DL models have
  been trained with strongly supervised learning methods. These methods depend on
  reference standard labels, typically applied manually by experts. In contrast, weakly

  only a portion of the data are labeled (incomplete supervision), labels refer to
