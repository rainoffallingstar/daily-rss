description: Hundreds of millions of people worldwide are expected to suffer from
  diabetes mellitus. Diabetes is characterized as a dynamic and heterogeneous disease
  that requires deeper understanding of the pathophysiology, genetics, and metabolic
  shaping of this disease and its macro/microvascular complications. Macrophages play
  an essential role in regulating local immune responses, tissue homeostasis, and
  disease pathogenesis. Here, we have analyzed transforming growth factor beta 1 ...
