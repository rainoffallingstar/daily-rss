description: The inducers of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation are heterogeneous
  and consequently, there is no specific pathway or signature molecule indispensable
  for NET formation. But certain events such as histone modification, chromatin decondensation,
  nuclear envelope breakdown, and NET release are ubiquitous. During NET formation,
  neutrophils drastically rearrange their cytoplasmic, granular and nuclear content.
  Yet, the exact mechanism for decoding each step during NET formation ...
