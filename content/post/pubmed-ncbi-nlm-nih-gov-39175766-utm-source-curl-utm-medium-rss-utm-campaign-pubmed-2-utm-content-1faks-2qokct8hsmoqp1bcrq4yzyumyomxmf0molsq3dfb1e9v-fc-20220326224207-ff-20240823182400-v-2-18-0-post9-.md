description: Negative-going responses in sensory cortex co-vary with perceptual awareness
  of sensory stimuli. Given that this awareness negativity has also been observed
  for undetected stimuli, some have challenged its role for perception. To address
  this question, we combined magnetoencephalography, electroencephalography, and pupillometry
  to study how sustained attention and response criterion affect the auditory awareness
  negativity. Participants first detected distractor sounds and denied ...
