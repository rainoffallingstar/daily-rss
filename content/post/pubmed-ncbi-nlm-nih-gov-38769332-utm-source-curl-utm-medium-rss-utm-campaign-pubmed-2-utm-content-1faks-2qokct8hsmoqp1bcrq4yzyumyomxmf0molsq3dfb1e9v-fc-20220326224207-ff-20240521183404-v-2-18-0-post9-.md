description: The function and phenotype of γδ T cells in the context of common variable
  immunodeficiency (CVID) has not been explored. CVID is a primary immunodeficiency
  disorder characterized by impaired antibody responses resulting in increased susceptibility
  to infections. γδ T cells are a subset of unconventional T cells that play crucial
  roles in host defence against infections. In this study, we aim to determine the
  roles and functions of γδ T cells in CVID. We observe a higher frequency of Vδ1^(+)
