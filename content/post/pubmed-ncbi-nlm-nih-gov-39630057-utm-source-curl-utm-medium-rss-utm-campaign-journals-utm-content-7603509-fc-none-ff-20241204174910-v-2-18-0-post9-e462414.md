description: Interferon-alpha has activity against multiple myeloma. Modakafusp alfa
  is an immunocytokine comprising two attenuated interferon-alpha2b molecules and
  an anti-CD38 IgG4 antibody, targeting delivery of interferon-alpha to CD38+ immune
  and myeloma cells. This phase I/II trial (NCT03215030) enrolled patients with relapsed/refractory
  multiple myeloma with ≥3 prior lines of treatment and refractory to or intolerant
  of ≥1 proteasome inhibitor and ≥1 immunomodulatory drug. During dose ...
