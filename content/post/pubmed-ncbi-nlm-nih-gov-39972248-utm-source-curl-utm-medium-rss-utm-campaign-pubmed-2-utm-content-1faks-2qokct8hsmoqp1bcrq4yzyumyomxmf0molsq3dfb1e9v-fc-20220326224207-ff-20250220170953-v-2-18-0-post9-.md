description: 'BACKGROUND: The introduction of (m)FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine-nab-paclitaxel
  has changed the perspective for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer
  (LAPC). Consequently, in experienced centres 23% of patients with LAPC undergo a
  resection with 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of up to 25%. In the Netherlands,
  the nationwide resection rate for LAPC remains low at 8%. The PREOPANC-4 program
