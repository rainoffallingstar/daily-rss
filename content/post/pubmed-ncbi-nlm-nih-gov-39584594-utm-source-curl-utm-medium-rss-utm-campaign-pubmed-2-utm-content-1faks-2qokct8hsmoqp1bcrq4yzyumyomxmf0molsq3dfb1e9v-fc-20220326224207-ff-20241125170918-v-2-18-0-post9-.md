description: Real-time monitoring of therapeutic drugs is crucial for treatment management
  and pharmacokinetic studies. We present the optimization and affinity tuning of
  split-aptamer sandwich assay for real-time monitoring of the narrow therapeutic
  window drug vancomycin, using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). To achieve reversible,
  label-free sensing of small molecules by SPR, we adapted a vancomycin binding aptamer
  in a sandwich assay format through the split-aptamer approach. By evaluating ...
