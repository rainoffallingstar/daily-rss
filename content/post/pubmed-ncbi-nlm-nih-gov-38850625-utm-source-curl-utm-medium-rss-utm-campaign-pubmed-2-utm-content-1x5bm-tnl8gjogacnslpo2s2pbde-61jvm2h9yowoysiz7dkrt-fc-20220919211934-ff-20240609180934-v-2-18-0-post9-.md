  disease (AD) and its development from different perspectives. Such information is
  closely related to the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of AD, and hence it
  is necessary and critical to study AD through multi-modal data. Existing learning
  methods, however, usually ignore the influence of feature heterogeneity and directly
