description: Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), a versatile metabolic cofactor, is
  emerging as an important non-canonical RNA cap across various life domains. This
  review explores FAD's dual role as a coenzyme and an RNA modifier, focusing on its
  incorporation as a 5' cap structure during transcription initiation and its subsequent
  implications for RNA metabolism and cellular functions. A comprehensive view of
  the mechanisms underlying FAD capping and decapping is presented, highlighting key
  enzymes ...
