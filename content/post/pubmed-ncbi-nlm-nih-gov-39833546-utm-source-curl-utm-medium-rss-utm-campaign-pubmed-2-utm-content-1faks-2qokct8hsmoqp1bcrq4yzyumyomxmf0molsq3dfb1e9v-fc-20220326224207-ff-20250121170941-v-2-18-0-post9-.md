description: Glioblastoma (GBM), the most malignant primary brain tumor in adults,
  has poor prognosis irrespective of therapeutic advances due to its radio-resistance
  and infiltrative growth into brain tissue. The present study assessed functions
  and putative druggability of BRCA1-associated ATM activator 1 (BRAT1) as a crucial
  factor driving key aspects of GBM, including enhanced DNA damage response and tumor
  migration. By a stable depletion of BRAT1 in GBM and glioma stem-like (GSC) cell
  lines, we ...
