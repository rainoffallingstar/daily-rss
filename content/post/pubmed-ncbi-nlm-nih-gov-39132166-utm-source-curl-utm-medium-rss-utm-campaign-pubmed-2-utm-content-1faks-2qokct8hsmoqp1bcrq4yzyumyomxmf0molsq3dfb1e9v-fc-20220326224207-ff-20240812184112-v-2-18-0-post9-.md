description: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in the pathogenesis of esophageal
  squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). This study aimed to explore the mechanisms of aberrant
  expression and functions of circ_0006168 in ESCC. In this study, real-time qPCR
  and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are adopted to estimate the expression
  and localization of circ_0006168 in cancer tissues and cells. Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation
  (MeRIP) was performed to detect the N⁶-methyladenosine (m⁶A) modification ...
