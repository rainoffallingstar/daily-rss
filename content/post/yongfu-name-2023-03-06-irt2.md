description: In Part 1, we went through the simplest item response model, the 1PL
  model, from the perspective of simulations. Starting with item difficulty and testee
  ability, we worked forward to simulate item responses that mimic real-world data.
  Back then, we were precisely laying out the data generating process that is assumed
  by the item response theory. In this post, we work backward. We will start with
  the item responses and work back toward the unobserved difficulties and abilities,
  with the help of statistical ...
