description: Schwannomatoses (SWN) are distinct cancer predisposition syndromes caused
  by germline pathogenic variants in the genes NF2, SMARCB1, or LZTR1. There is significant
  clinical overlap between these syndromes with the hallmark of increased risk for
  cranial, spinal and peripheral schwannomas. Neurofibromatosis type 2 was recently
  renamed as NF2-related SWN and is the most common SWN syndrome with increased risk
  for bilateral vestibular schwannomas, intradermal schwannomas, meningiomas and ...
