  incurable disease with high unmet medical need. "Off-the-shelf" T-cell bispecific
  antibodies (TCBs) targeting BCMA and GPRC5D have demonstrated high objective response
  rates (ORR) in heavily pre-treated MM patients, however, primary resistance, short
  duration of response and relapse driven by antigen shift frequently occurs. Although
