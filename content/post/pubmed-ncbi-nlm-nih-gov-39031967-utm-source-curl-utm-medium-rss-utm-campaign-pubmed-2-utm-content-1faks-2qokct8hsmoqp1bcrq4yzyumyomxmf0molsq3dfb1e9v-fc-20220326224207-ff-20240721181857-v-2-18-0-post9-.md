description: Single-cell analyses can be confounded by assigning unrelated groups
  of cells to common developmental trajectories. For instance, cancer cells and admixed
  normal epithelial cells could adopt similar cell states thus complicating analyses
  of their developmental potential. Here, we develop and benchmark CCISM (for Cancer
  Cell Identification using Somatic Mutations) to exploit genomic single nucleotide
  variants for the disambiguation of cancer cells from genomically normal non-cancer
  cells ...
