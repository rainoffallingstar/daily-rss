description: Heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) can be triggered by at
  least 18 genes. The most frequently altered gene is the bone morphogenetic protein
  receptor 2 (BMPR2). Further genes from the same pathway are also well known PAH-causing
  genes. Genetic testing can aid to confirm differential diagnoses such as a pulmonary
  veno-occlusive disease. It also enables the testing of healthy family members. In
  addition to the PAH patient population particularly served by genetic testing, this
