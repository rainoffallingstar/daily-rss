  integrated into the clinical workflow. Even without a fleshed out user interface,
  the SUS already yielded borderline good results. Expert surgeons rated the functionalities
  favorably, and most of them expressed their willingness to work with a similar application
  in the future. Thus, Aliado can serve as a surgical vision of how an ideal AI-based
