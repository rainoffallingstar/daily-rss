description: A wide range of acute brain injuries, including both traumatic and non-traumatic
  causes, can result in elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), which in turn can cause
  further secondary injury to the brain, initiating a vicious cascade of propagating
  injury. Elevated ICP is therefore a neurological injury that requires intensive
  monitoring and time-sensitive interventions. Patients at high risk for developing
  elevated ICP undergo placement of invasive ICP monitors including external ...
