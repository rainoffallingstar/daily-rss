description: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed cancer treatment
  but are frequently associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs). This article
  offers a novel synthesis of findings from both preclinical and clinical studies,
  focusing on the molecular mechanisms driving irAEs across diverse organ systems.
  It examines key immune cells, such as T cell subsets and myeloid cells, which are
  instrumental in irAE pathogenesis, alongside an in-depth analysis of cytokine ...
