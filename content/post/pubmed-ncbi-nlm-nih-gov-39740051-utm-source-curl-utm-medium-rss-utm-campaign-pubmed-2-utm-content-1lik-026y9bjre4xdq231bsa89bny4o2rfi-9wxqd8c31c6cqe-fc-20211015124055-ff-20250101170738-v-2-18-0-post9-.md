description: 'CONCLUSIONS: In the cases identified to date, A(H5N1) viruses generally
  caused mild illness, mostly conjunctivitis, of short duration, predominantly in
  U.S. adults exposed to infected animals; most patients received prompt antiviral
  treatment. No evidence of human-to-human A(H5N1) transmission was identified. PPE
  use among occupationally exposed persons was suboptimal, which suggests that additional
  strategies are needed to reduce exposure risk. (Funded by the Centers for Disease
