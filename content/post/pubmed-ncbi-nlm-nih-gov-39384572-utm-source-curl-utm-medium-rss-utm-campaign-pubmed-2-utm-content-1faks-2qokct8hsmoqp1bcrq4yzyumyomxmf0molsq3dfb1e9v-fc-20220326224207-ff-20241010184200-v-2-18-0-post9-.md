description: Positive-ion laser desorption/ionization (LDI) of fullerenes contained
  in soot as produced by the Krätschmer-Huffman process delivers a wide range of fullerene
  molecular ions from C(56)^(+•) to above C(300)^(+•). Here, the collision cross section
  (CCS) values of those fullerene molecular ions are determined using a trapped ion
  mobility-quadrupole-time-of-flight (TIMS-Q-TOF) instrument. While CCS values in
  the range from C(60)^(+•) to C(96)^(+•) are already known with high accuracy, those
  of ...
