  and RMT ratio individually are sensitive markers associated with the motor outcome
  7 days and 3 months after tumor resection in a presumed motor eloquent location.
  They can therefore supply valuable information during preoperative risk-benefit-balancing.
  However, underlying neurophysiological mechanisms might be too similar to make the
