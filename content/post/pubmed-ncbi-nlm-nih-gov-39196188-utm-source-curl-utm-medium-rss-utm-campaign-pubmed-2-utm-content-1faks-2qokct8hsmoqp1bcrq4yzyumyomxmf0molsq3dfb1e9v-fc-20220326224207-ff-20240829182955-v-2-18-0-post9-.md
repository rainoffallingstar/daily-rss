description: Tissue repair after myocardial infarction (MI) is guided by autocrine
  and paracrine-acting proteins. Deciphering these signals and their upstream triggers
  is essential when considering infarct healing as a therapeutic target. Here we perform
  a bioinformatic secretome analysis in mouse cardiac endothelial cells and identify
  cysteine-rich with EGF-like domains 2 (CRELD2), an endoplasmic reticulum stress-inducible
  protein with poorly characterized function. CRELD2 was abundantly expressed ...
