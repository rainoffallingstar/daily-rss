description: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease impacting
  the lives of millions of people worldwide. The formation of amyloid β (Aβ) plagues
  in the brain is the main pathological hallmark of AD. The Aβ deposits are formed
  due to the imbalance between the production and Aβ clearance in the brain and across
  the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this respect, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein 1 (LRP1) plays a significant role by mediating both brain Aβ production
