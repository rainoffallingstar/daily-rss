description: The progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is significantly
  affected by TGF-β but targeting TGF-β can also compromize physiological effects
  in patients. Our study examined the functions of the ubiquitously expressed protein,
  PDCD10, as a modulator of TGF-β signaling. Using in silico analyses we found that
  in patient samples, PDCD10 is significantly higher expressed in PDAC tumor tissue
  compared to normal pancreas and it is highly correlated with reduced survival. We
