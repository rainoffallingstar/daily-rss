description: The Etoliko Lagoon in western Greece has experienced extensive human
  modification since the 20th century, both on the surrounding land and in the aquatic
  environment. To examine human impacts and disentangle climatic from anthropogenic
  changes, we present a suite of biomarker records that span the past two centuries
  (~1790-2011). Specifically, we use terrigenous (n-alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
  (PAHs), and phytosterols) and aquatic (dinosterol, brassicasterol, cholesterol,
