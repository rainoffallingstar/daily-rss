description: Pineal parenchymal tumors are rare neoplasms for which evidence-based
  treatment recommendations are lacking. These tumors vary in biology, clinical characteristics,
  and prognosis, requiring treatment that ranges from surgical resection alone to
  intensive multimodal antineoplastic therapy. Recently, international collaborative
  studies have shed light on the genomic landscape of these tumors, leading to refinement
  in molecular-based disease classification in the 5th edition of the World ...
