description: In recent years, porous organic cages have gained in importance, inter
  alia, due to their ability to be processed from solution. Especially the packing
  of the cages in the solid state structure has a significant effect on the porosity.
  Therefore, it is important to be able control the packing pattern either by crystallization
  conditions or the interaction of molecular units, defined as crystal engineering
  synthons. Here, tribromoarene subunits as such are incorporated into cage ...
