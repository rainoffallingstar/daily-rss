description: DEAD box (DDX) RNA helicases are a large family of ATPases, many of which
  have unknown functions. There is emerging evidence that besides their role in RNA
  biology, DDX proteins may stimulate protein kinases. To investigate if protein kinase-DDX
  interaction is a more widespread phenomenon, we conducted three orthogonal large-scale
  screens, including proteomics analysis with 32 RNA helicases, protein array profiling,
  and kinome-wide in vitro kinase assays. We retrieved Ser/Thr protein kinases ...
