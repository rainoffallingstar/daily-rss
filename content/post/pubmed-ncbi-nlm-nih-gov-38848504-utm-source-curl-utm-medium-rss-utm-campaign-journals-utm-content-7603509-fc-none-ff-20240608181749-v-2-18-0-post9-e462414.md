description: Red blood cells (RBC) express high levels of hemoglobin A tetramer (HbA,
  22) to facilitate oxygen (O2) transport. Hemoglobin and related proteins are also
  expressed at lower levels in other tissues across the animal kingdom. Physiological
  functions for most non-erythroid globins likely derive from their ability to catalyze

  iron. An interesting example is illustrated by the recent discovery that -globin
