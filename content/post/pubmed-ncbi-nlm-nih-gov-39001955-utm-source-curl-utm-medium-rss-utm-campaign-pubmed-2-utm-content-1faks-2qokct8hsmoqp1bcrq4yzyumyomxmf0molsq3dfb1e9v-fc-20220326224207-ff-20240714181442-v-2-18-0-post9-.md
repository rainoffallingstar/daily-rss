description: The aim of the proof-of-concept study is to investigate the level of
  concordance between the heart rate variability (HRV), the EEG-based Narcotrend Index
  as a surrogate marker for the depth of hypnosis, and the minimal alveolar concentration
  (MAC) of the inhalation anesthetic sevoflurane across the entire course of a surgical
  procedure. This non-blinded cross-sectional study recorded intraoperative HRV, Narcotrend
  Index, and MAC in 31 male patients during radical prostatectomy using the ...
