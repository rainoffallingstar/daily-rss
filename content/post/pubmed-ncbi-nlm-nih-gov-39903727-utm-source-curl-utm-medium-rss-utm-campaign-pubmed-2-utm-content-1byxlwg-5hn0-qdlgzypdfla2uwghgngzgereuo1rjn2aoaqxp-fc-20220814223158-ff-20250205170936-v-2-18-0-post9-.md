description: Adenomyosis and leiomyomas are common benign uterine disorders characterized
  by abnormal cellular proliferation. The BCL6 protein, a transcriptional repressor
  implicated in cell proliferation and oncogenesis, has been linked to the pathogenesis
  of endometriosis. This study investigates BCL6 expression in adenomyosis, leiomyomas,
  and normal myometrium using immunohistochemistry and deep learning neural networks.
  We analyzed paraffin blocks from total hysterectomies performed between 2009 ...
