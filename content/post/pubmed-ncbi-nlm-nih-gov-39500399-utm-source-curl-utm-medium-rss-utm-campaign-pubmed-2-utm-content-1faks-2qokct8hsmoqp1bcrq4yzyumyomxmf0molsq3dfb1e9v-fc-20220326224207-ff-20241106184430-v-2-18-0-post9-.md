description: This study explores carbon dioxide enrichment in anaerobic digestion
  to boost biomethane production and assess degradation kinetics and methanogenic
  pathway evolution. Carbon dioxide enrichment was found to improve inoculum digestion,
  supplying additional energy for methanogenic archaea. The methane yield of blank
  inocula increased by 53 % to 77 % after carbon dioxide enrichment. Although further
  digestion of inoculum residues took longer, rapid adaptation led to an increased
  methane ...
