description: Quantifying Lewis acidity is essential for understanding and optimizing
  the performance of Lewis acids in diverse applications. Next to the widely accepted
  Gutmann-Beckett (GB) method, using triethyl phosphine oxide (TEPO) as a probe, the
  Childs method-employing trans-crotonaldehyde (TCA)-gained attention as an NMR-based
  technique for measuring effective Lewis acidity (eLA). Despite its steady use, the
  robustness of Childs method and its correlation with other measures remain ...
