   <p>Like <a href="https://robjhyndman.com">Rob</a>, I have wished to ditch Disqus for a long
  time, which I have used for more than a decade. I was aware of <a href="https://masalmon.eu/2019/10/02/disqus/">Maëlle Salmon&rsquo;s
  work</a> in 2019 (and <a href="https://nanx.me/blog/post/migrating-from-disqus-to-utterances/">Nan
  Xiao&rsquo;s</a> in
  2020), but hesitated at that time. Unlike Maëlle, removing Disqus was both
  emotionally and technically hard for me because I had more than 10K comments in
  Disqus, in which I had a lot of memories of the old days!</p> <h2 id="the-problems-that-i-had-for-disqus ...
