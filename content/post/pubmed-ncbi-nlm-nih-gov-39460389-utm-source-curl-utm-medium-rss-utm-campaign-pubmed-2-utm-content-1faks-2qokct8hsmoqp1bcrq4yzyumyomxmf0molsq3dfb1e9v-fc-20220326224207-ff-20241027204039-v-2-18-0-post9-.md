description: During pregnancy, the maternal immune system must carefully balance protection
  against pathogens with tolerance toward the semiallogeneic fetus. Dysfunctions of
  the immune system can lead to severe complications such as preeclampsia, fetal growth
  restriction, or pregnancy loss. Adenosine plays a role in physiological processes
  and plasma-level increase during pregnancy. The adenosine receptor A2B (A2BR), which
  is expressed on both, immune and nonimmune cells, is activated by high ...
