description: The microbiota, comprising bacteria, fungi, and viruses residing within
  our body, functions as a key modulator in host health and states, including immune
  responses. Studies have linked microbiota and microbiota-derived metabolites to
  immune cell functions. In this review, we probe the complex relationship between
  the human microbiota and clinical outcomes of cellular therapies that leverage immune
