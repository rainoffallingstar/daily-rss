description: The prognosis of pancreatic cancer (PDAC) after tumor resection remains
  poor, mostly due to a high but variable risk of recurrence. A promising tool for
  improved prognostication is the quantification of CT tumor enhancement. For this,
  various enhancement formulas have been used in previous studies. However, a systematic
  comparison of these formulas is lacking. In the present study, we applied twenty-three
  previously published CT enhancement formulas to our cohort of 92 PDAC patients ...
