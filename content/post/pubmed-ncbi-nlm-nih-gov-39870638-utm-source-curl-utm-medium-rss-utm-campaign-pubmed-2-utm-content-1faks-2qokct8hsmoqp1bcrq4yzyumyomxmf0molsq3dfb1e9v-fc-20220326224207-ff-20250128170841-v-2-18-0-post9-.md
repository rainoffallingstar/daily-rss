description: Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a cytogenetically heterogeneous clonal plasma
  cell proliferative disease whose diagnosis is supported by analyses on histological
  slides of bone marrow aspirate. In summary, experts use a labor-intensive methodology
  to compute the ratio between plasma cells and non-plasma cells. Therefore, the key
  aspect of the methodology is identifying these cells, which relies on the experts'
