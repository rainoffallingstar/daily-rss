description: Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is known as a rare etiology of embolic
  ischemic stroke. In individuals below 50 years, up to 20% of strokes are associated
  with APS, whereas in patients >50 years, it is considered a very seldom cause of
  stroke. We describe the course of a 66-year-old white woman, who experienced four
  embolic strokes with large vessel occlusion over a period of 2 years, which were
  repeatedly and successfully treated by mechanical thrombectomy. Initially attributed
