description: We demonstrate efficient subthermal cooling of the modified cyclotron
  mode of a single trapped antiproton and reach particle temperatures T_{+}=E_{+}/k_{B}
  below 200 mK in preparation times shorter than 500 s. This corresponds to the fastest
  resistive single-particle cyclotron cooling to subthermal temperatures ever demonstrated.
  By cooling trapped particles to such low energies, we demonstrate the detection
  of antiproton spin transitions with an error rate <0.000 023, more than 3 orders
