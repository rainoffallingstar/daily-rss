description: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common, deadly disease with an increasing
  incidence despite preventive efforts. Clinical observations have associated elevated
  antibody concentrations or antibody-based therapies with thrombotic events. However,
  how antibodies contribute to thrombosis is unknown. Here, we show that reduced blood
  flow enabled immunoglobulin M (IgM) to bind to FcμR and the polymeric immunoglobulin
  receptor (pIgR), initiating endothelial activation and platelet ...
