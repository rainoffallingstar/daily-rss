description: Thyroid hormones (THs) act early in ontogenesis, even prior to the differentiation
  of thyrocytes. Maternal transfer of THs is therefore known to play an essential
  role in early development. Current OECD test guidelines for the assessment of TH
  system disruption (THSD) do not address inter- or transgenerational effects. The
  integrated fish endocrine disruptor test (iFEDT), a test combining parental and
  developmental exposure of filial fish, may fill this gap. We tested the ability
  of the iFEDT ...
