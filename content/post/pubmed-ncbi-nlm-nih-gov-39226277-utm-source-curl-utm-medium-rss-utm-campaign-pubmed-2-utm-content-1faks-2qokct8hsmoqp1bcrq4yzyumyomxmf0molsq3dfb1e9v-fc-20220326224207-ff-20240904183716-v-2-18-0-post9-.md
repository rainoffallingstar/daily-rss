description: 'DNMT1 is an essential DNA methyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer
  of methyl groups to CpG islands in DNA and generates a prominent epigenetic mark.
  The catalytic activity of DNMT1 relies on its conformational plasticity and ability
  to change conformation from an auto-inhibited to an activated state. Here, we present
  four cryo-EM reconstructions of apo DNMT1 and DNTM1: non-productive DNA, DNTM1:
