description: Gadopsis (Percichthyidae) is a freshwater genus distributed in south-eastern
  Australia, including Tasmania, and comprises two recognized species. Previous molecular
  phylogenetic investigations of the genus, mostly conducted in the pre-genomics era
  and reflecting a range of geographic and molecular sampling intensities, have supported
  the recognition of up to seven candidate species. Here we analyze a genome-wide
  SNP dataset that provides comprehensive geographic and genomic coverage of ...
