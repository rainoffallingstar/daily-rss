description: Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is characterized by congenital absence
  of ganglion cells in the gastrointestinal tract, which leads to impaired defecation,
  constipation and intestinal obstruction. The current diagnosis of HSCR is based
  on Rectal Suction Biopsies (RSBs), which could be complex in newborns. Occasionally,
  there is a delay in diagnosis that can increase the risk of clinical complications.
  Consequently, there is room for new non-invasive diagnostic methods that are objective,
