description: A phase 2, international, open-label, non-randomized, single-arm trial
  was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tipifarnib, a farnesyltransferase
  inhibitor, as monotherapy for relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL)
  and to evaluate tumor mutation profile as a biomarker of response. Adults with relapsed/refractory
  PTCL received tipifarnib 300 mg orally twice daily for 21 days in a 28-day cycle.
  The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR); secondary ...
