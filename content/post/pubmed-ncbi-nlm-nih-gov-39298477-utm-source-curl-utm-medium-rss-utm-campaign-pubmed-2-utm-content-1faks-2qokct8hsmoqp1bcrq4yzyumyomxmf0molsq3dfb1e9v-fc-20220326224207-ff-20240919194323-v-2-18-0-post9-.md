description: Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a rare blood cancer of older
  adults (3 in every 1,000,000 persons) characterized by poor survival and lacking
  effective mutation-specific therapy. Mutations in the ubiquitin ligase Cbl occur
  frequently in CMML and share biological and molecular features with a clonal disease
  occurring in children, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). Here we analyzed
  the clinical presentations, molecular features and immunophenotype of CMML patients
