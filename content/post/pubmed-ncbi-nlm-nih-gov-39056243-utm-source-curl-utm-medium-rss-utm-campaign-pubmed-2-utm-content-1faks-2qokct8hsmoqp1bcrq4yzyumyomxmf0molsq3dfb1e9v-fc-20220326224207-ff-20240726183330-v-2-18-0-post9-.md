description: This study investigates attention modulation as a function of infant
  directed (ID) versus adult directed (AD) speech in seven-month-old infants using
  electroencephalographic measures. In three experiments, infants were presented with
  either ID speech or AD speech as stimuli, followed by highly variable images of
  inanimate objects as targets. In Experiment 1 (N = 18), images were preceded by
  ID or AD speech with semantic content ("Look here"). Contrary to hypothesis, targets
  preceded by AD ...
