description: This study investigates the impact of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus
  deep brain stimulation (ANT-DBS) on patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE)
  in Iran, specifically focusing on its effects on seizure metrics, severity and its
  influence on quality of life over time. A cohort of eight patients with DRE in Iran
  who underwent ANT-DBS was evaluated. Pre-operative assessments included comprehensive
  documentation of seizure frequency, duration, severity scores, and the Quality of
  Life ...
