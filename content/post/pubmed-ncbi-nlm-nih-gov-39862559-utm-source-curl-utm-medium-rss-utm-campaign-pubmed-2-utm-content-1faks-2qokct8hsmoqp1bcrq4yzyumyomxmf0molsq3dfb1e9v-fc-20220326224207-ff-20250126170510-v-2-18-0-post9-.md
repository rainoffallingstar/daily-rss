description: Two event-related brain potential (ERP) components, the frontocentral
  feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the posterior P300, are key in feedback processing.
  The FRN typically exhibits greater amplitude in response to negative and unexpected
  outcomes, whereas the P300 is generally more pronounced for positive outcomes. In
  an influential ERP study, Hajcak et al., (2005) manipulated outcome valence and
  expectancy in a guessing task. They found the FRN was larger for negative outcomes
