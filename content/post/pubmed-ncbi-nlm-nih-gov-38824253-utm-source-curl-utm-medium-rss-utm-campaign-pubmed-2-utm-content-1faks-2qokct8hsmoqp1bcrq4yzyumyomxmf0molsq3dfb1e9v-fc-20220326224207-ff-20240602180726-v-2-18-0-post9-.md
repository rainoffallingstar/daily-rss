description: The development of treatments targeting the vascular endothelial growth
  factor (VEGF) signaling pathways have traditionally been firstly investigated in
  oncology and then advanced into retinal disease indications. Members of the VEGF
  family of endogenous ligands and their respective receptors play a central role
  in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis during both development and physiological homeostasis.
  They can also play a pathogenic role in cancer and retinal diseases. Therapeutic
