description: Image-based spatial transcriptomic sequencing technologies have enabled
  the measurement of gene expression at single-cell resolution, but with a limited
  number of genes. Current computational approaches attempt to overcome these limitations
  by imputing missing genes, but face challenges regarding prediction accuracy and
  identification of cell populations due to the neglect of gene-gene relationships.
  In this context, we present stImpute, a method to impute spatial transcriptomics
