description: Wastewater contains an extensive reservoir of genetic information, yet
  largely unexplored. Here, we analyzed by high-throughput sequencing total nucleic
  acids extracted from wastewater samples collected during a 17 month-period in Berlin,
  Germany. By integrating global wastewater datasets and applying a novel computational
  approach to accurately identify viral strains within sewage RNA-sequencing data,
  we demonstrated the emergence and global dissemination of a specific astrovirus
