description: Aquaporin-0 (AQP0) tetramers form square arrays in lens membranes through
  a yet unknown mechanism, but lens membranes are enriched in sphingomyelin and cholesterol.
  Here, we determined electron crystallographic structures of AQP0 in sphingomyelin/cholesterol
  membranes and performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to establish that the
  observed cholesterol positions represent those seen around an isolated AQP0 tetramer
  and that the AQP0 tetramer largely defines the location and orientation ...
