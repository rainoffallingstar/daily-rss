description: This study is to produce biogenic silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) by utilizing
  aqueous extracts derived from Turnera Sublata (TS) leaves under visible light. Subsequently,
  these nanoparticles are coated with eosin-yellow (EY) to enhance sensitivity and
  selectivity in L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa) detection. This method encompasses
  the deposition of metal onto the Ag NPs, resulting in the formation of EY-AgNPs.
  The crystalline, spherical nanoparticles, prepared as described, exhibit ...
