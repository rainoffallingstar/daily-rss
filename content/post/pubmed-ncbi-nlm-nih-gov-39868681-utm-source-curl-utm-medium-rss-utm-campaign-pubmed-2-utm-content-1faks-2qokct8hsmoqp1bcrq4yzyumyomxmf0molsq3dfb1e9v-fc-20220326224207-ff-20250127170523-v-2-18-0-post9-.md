description: This study investigates the associations between early childhood adversities,
  stress perception, and fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Although the interconnection
  between dysregulated stress systems and FMS is well documented, the interconnection
  between early adversities and FMS remains less understood. This study explores the
  relationship of early-life stress and FMS by examining its mediation through perceived
  stress, and acute and chronic endocrine stress indicators. Stress was assessed ...
