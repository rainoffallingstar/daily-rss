description: Cardiac signaling pathways functionally important in the heart's response
  to exercise often protect the heart against pathologic stress, potentially providing
  novel therapeutic targets. However, it is important to determine which of these
  pathways can be feasibly targeted in vivo. Transgenic overexpression of exercise-induced
  CITED4 has been shown to protect against adverse remodeling after ischemia/reperfusion
