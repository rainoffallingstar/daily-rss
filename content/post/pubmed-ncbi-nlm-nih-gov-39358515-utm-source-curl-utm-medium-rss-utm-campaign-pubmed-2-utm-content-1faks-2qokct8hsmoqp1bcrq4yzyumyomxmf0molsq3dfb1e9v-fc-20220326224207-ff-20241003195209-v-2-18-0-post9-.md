  external world^(1,2). Excitatory cortical neurons are often precisely tuned to specific
  external stimuli^(3,4). However, inhibitory neurons, such as parvalbumin-positive
  (PV) interneurons, are generally less selective⁵. PV interneurons differ from excitatory
  neurons in their neurotransmitter receptor subtypes, including AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole
