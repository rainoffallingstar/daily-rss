description: Droplet microfluidics has become a very powerful tool in high-throughput
  screening, including antibody discovery. Screens are usually carried out by physically
  sorting droplets hosting cells of the desired phenotype, breaking them, recovering
  the encapsulated cells, and sequencing the paired antibody light and heavy chain
  genes at the single-cell level. This series of multiple consecutive manipulation
  steps of rare screening hits is complex and challenging, resulting in a significant
