description: In traditional game theory tasks, social decision-making is centered
  on the prediction of the intentions (i.e., mentalizing) of strangers or manipulated
  responses. In contrast, real-life scenarios often involve familiar individuals in
  dynamic environments. Further research is needed to explore neural correlates of
  social decision-making with changes in the available information and environmental
  settings. This study collected fMRI hyperscanning data (N = 100, 46 same-sex pairs
  were analyzed) ...
