description: Intracellular trafficking involves an intricate machinery of motor complexes
  including the dynein complex to shuttle cargo for autophagolysosomal degradation.
  Deficiency in dynein axonemal chains as well as cytoplasmic light and intermediate
  chains have been linked with ciliary dyskinesia and skeletal dysplasia. The cytoplasmic
  dynein 1 heavy chain protein (DYNC1H1) serves as a core complex for retrograde trafficking
  in neuronal axons. Dominant pathogenic variants in DYNC1H1 have been ...
