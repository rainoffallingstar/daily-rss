description: 'CONCLUSION: When used in a clinical context, miLab™ demonstrated high
  sensitivity but low specificity. Expert intervention was shown to be required to
  improve the device''s specificity in its current version. miLab™ in the corrected
  mode performed similar to expert microscopy. Before clinical application, more refinement
  is needed to ensure full workflow automation and eliminate human intervention. Trial
