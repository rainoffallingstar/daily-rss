description: Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is an asymptomatic
  pre-malignant disorder. The current standard of care is not to screen for MGUS,
  so it is often incidentally diagnosed in the clinic. It is unknown whether the outcomes
  of screened versus clinically detected MGUS differ. We compared the progression
  risk between screened versus clinical MGUS cohorts and assessed whether the MGUS
  detection method impacted risk prediction of established clinical factors (score).
