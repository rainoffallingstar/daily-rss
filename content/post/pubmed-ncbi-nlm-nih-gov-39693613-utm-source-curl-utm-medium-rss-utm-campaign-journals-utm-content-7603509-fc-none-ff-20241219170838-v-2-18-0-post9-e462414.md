description: Accumulation of free α-globin is a critical factor in the pathogenesis
  of β-thalassemia. Autophagy plays a crucial role in clearing toxic free α-globin,
  thereby reducing disease severity. However, the impact of natural mutations in autophagy-related
  genes (ATGs) on the phenotypic variability of β-thalassemia remains unclear. In
  this study, we systematically investigated the relationship between variants in
  ATGs and disease phenotypes in a cohort of 1,022 patients with β-thalassemia, ...
