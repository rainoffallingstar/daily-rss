description: 'Objectives: To evaluate the fracture resistance of veneered incisor
  crowns made from highly translucent zirconia frameworks. Materials and Methods:
  Ninety-six all-ceramic single crowns were based on either a coping with minimum
  wall thickness or a cutback framework fabricated from highly translucent zirconia
  (5Y-PSZ). Each one-third of the specimens was finalized with different veneering
  ceramics using standardizations and glaze firing. Crowns were luted to cobalt-chromium
  dies ...'
