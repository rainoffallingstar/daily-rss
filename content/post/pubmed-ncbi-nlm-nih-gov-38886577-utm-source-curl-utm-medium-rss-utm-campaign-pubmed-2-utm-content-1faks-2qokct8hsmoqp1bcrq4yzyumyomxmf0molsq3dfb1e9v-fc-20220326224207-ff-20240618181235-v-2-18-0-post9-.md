description: In a human cell, thousands of replication forks simultaneously coordinate
  duplication of the entire genome. The rate at which this process occurs might depend
  on the epigenetic state of the genome and vary between, or even within, cell types.
  To accurately measure DNA replication speeds, we developed single-cell 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine
  sequencing to detect nascent replicated DNA. We observed that the DNA replication
  speed is not constant but increases during S phase of the cell cycle. ...
