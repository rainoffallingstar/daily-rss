description: 'CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that advanced age, higher NIHSS
  scores, elevated pre-stroke mRS, and pre-operative glucose levels significantly
  predict very poor outcomes in AIS-MeVO patients who received MT. These findings
  highlight the importance of a comprehensive risk assessment in primary MeVO patients
