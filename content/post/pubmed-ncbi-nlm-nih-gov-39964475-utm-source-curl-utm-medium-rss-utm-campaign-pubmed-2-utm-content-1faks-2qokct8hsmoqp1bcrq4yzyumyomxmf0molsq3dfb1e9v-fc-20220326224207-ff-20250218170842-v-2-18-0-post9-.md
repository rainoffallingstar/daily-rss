description: During meiosis, the number and distribution of crossovers (COs) must
  be precisely regulated through CO assurance and interference to prevent chromosome
  missegregation and genomic instability in the progeny. Here we show that this regulation
  of COs depends on a disordered and conserved domain within the synaptonemal complex
  (SC). This domain is located at the C-terminus of the central element protein SYP-4
  in Caenorhabditis elegans. While not necessary for synapsis, the C-terminus of SYP-4
