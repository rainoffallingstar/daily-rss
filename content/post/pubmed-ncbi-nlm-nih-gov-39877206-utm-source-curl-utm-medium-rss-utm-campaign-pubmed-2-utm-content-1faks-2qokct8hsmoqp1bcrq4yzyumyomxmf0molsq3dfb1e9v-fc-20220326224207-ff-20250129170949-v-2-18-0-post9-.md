description: Botulinum toxin-A (BTX-A) is widely used for aesthetic purposes and is
  recognized for its vasomotor actions. However, new medical applications have emerged.
  This study aims to describe the effect of BTX-A on human skin perfusion, particularly
  vessel diameter, blood flow, and blood vessel density in regions with known low
  vessel density. This case series involved 40 patients who were treated with subcutaneous
  injections of BTX-A and sodium chloride 0.9% into marked skin areas on their backs.
