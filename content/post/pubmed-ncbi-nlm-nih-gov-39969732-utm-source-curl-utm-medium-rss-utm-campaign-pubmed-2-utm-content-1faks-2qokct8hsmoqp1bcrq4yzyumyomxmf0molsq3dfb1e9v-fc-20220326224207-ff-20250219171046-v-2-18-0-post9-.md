description: 'Glutaric aciduria type 1 (OMIM #231670) is a rare inherited neurometabolic
  disorder of lysine and tryptophan metabolism. The deficiency of mitochondrial glutaryl-CoA
  dehydrogenase activity leads to an accumulation of neurotoxic metabolites such as
  glutaric acid and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid in the body. Most untreated patients develop
  a dystonic movement disorder due to striatal injury during the first years of life
  associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, early diagnosis ...'
