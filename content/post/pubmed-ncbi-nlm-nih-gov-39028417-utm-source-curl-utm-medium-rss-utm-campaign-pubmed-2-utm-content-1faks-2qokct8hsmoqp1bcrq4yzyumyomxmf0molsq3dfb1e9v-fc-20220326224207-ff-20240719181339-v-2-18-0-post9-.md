description: Dysregulated progenitor cell populations may contribute to poor placental
  development and placental insufficiency pathogenesis. Side-population cells possess
  progenitor properties. Recent human trophoblast side-population isolation identified
  enrichment of 8 specific genes (CXCL8, ELL2, GATA6, HK2, HLA-DPB1, INTS6, SERPINE3
  and UPP1) (Gamage et al. 2020, Stem Cell Rev Rep). We characterised these trophoblast
  side-population markers in human placenta and in placental insufficiency ...
