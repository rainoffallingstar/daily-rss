description: We present the proteomic profiling of 79 bladder cancers, including treatment-naïve
  non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC, n = 17), muscle-invasive bladder cancer
  (MIBC, n = 51), and neoadjuvant-treated MIBC (n = 11). Proteins were extracted from
  formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples and analyzed using data-independent acquisition,
  yielding >8,000 quantified proteins. MIBC, compared to NMIBC, shows an extracellular
  matrix (ECM) and immune response signature as well as alteration of ...
