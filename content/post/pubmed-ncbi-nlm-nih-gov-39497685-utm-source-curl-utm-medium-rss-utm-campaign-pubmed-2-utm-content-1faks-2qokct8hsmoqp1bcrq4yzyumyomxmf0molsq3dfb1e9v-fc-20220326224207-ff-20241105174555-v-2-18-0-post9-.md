description: Constructed with used plastic bottles, the eco-cooler has been widely
  adopted in resource-poor communities in Bangladesh and other countries. We tested
  the eco-cooler under controlled conditions using a scientific wind tunnel in a climatic
  chamber. In our tests, we used seven eco-cooler designs in 27 climate conditions
  typical of Bangladesh (temperatures of 40 °C, 35 °C, and 30 °C; humidity levels
  of 70%, 60%, and 40%; and wind speeds of 4.0 m s^(-1), 2.0 m s^(-1), and 0.2 m s^(-1))
