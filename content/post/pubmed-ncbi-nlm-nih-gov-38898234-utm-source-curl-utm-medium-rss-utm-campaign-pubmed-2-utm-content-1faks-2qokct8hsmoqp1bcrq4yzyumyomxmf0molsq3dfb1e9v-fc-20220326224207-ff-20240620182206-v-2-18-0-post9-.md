description: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is the cornerstone of liquid biopsy diagnostics,
  revealing clinically relevant genomic aberrations from blood of cancer patients.
  Genomic analysis of single circulating tumor cells (CTCs) could provide additional
  insights into intra-patient heterogeneity, but it requires whole-genome amplification
  (WGA) of DNA, which might introduce bias. Here, we describe a novel approach based
  on mass spectrometry for mutation detection from individual CTCs not requiring WGA
