description: The axon initial segment (AIS) constitutes not only the site of action
  potential initiation, but also a hub for activity-dependent modulation of output
  generation. Recent studies shedding light on AIS function used predominantly post-hoc
  approaches since no robust murine in vivo live reporters exist. Here, we introduce
  a reporter line in which the AIS is intrinsically labeled by an ankyrin-G-GFP fusion
  protein activated by Cre recombinase, tagging the native Ank3 gene. Using ...
