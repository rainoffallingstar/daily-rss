  (1) with small dienophiles such as (bridged) dihydronaphthalenes/cyclohexenes that
  yielded adducts at the central ring, the other dienophiles predominantly or exclusively
  attacked the unsubstituted off-center ring. The difference in regioselectivity was
  investigated by DFT calculations. Apart from dispersion interactions, it is due
  to the steric demand of the dienophiles, which need to fit in between ...
