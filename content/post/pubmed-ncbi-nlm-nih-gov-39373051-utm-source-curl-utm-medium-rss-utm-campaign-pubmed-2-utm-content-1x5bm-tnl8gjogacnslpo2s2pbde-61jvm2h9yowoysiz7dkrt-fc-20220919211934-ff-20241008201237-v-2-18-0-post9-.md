description: Single-cell ribonucleic acid sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology can be
  used to perform high-resolution analysis of the transcriptomes of individual cells.
  Therefore, its application has gained popularity for accurately analyzing the ever-increasing
  content of heterogeneous single-cell datasets. Central to interpreting scRNA-seq
  data is the clustering of cells to decipher transcriptomic diversity and infer cell
  behavior patterns. However, its complexity necessitates the application of ...
