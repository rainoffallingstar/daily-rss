description: Large-scale omics profiling has uncovered a vast array of somatic mutations
  and cancer-associated proteins, posing substantial challenges for their functional
  interpretation. Here we present a network-based approach centered on FunMap, a pan-cancer
  functional network constructed using supervised machine learning on extensive proteomics
  and RNA sequencing data from 1,194 individuals spanning 11 cancer types. Comprising
  10,525 protein-coding genes, FunMap connects functionally associated ...
