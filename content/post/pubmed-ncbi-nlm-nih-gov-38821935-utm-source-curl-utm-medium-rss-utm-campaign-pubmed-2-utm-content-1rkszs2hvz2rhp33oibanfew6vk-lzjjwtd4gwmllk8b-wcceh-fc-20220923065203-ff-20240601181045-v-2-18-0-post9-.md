description: Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) is a rare lymphoma
  with sparse tumor B-cells and a favorable prognosis. Variant growth patterns of
  NLPHL, however, often show advanced stage, progression to T-cell/histiocyte-rich
  large B-cell lymphoma (THRLBCL) and a worse prognosis. We studied the tumor microenvironment
  (TME) of NLPHL and THRLBCL using highplex imaging and spatial profiling at the single
  cell level. Our findings show distinct differences in TME composition and ...
