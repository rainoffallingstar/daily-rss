description: Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), formed endogenously or obtained
  exogenously from diet, may contribute to chronic inflammation, intracellular signaling
  alterations, and pathogenesis of several chronic diseases including colorectal cancer
  (CRC). However, the role of AGEs in CRC survival is less known. The associations
  of pre-diagnostic circulating AGEs and their soluble receptor (sRAGE) with CRC-specific
  and overall mortality were estimated using multivariable-adjusted Cox ...
