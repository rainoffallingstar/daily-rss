description: Ion-beam radiotherapy is an advanced cancer treatment modality offering
  steep dose gradients and a high biological effectiveness. These gradients make the
  therapy vulnerable to patient-setup and anatomical changes between treatment fractions,
  which may go unnoticed. Charged fragments from nuclear interactions of the ion beam
  with the patient tissue may carry information about the treatment quality. Currently,
  the fragments escape the patient undetected. Inter-fractional in-vivo ...
