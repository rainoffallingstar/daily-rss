description: Nuclear receptor TR4 was previously shown to bind to the -117 position
  of the -globin gene promoters in vitro, which overlaps the more recently described
  BCL11A binding site. The role of TR4 in human -globin gene repression has not been
  extensively characterized in vivo, while any relationship between TR4 and BCL11A
  regulation through the -globin promoters is unclear at present. We show here that
  TR4 and BCL11A competitively bind in vitro to distinct, overlapping sequences, ...
