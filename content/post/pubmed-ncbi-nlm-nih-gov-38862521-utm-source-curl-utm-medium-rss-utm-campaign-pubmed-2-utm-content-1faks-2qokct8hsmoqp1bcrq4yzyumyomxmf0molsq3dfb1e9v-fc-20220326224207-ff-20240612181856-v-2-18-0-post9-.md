description: A key feature of cancer is the disruption of cell cycle regulation, which
  is characterized by the selective and abnormal activation of cyclin-dependent kinases
  (CDKs). Consequently, targeting CDKs via meriolins represents an attractive therapeutic
  approach for cancer therapy. Meriolins represent a semisynthetic compound class
  derived from meridianins and variolins with a known CDK inhibitory potential. Here,
  we analyzed the two novel derivatives meriolin 16 and meriolin 36 in comparison
  to ...
