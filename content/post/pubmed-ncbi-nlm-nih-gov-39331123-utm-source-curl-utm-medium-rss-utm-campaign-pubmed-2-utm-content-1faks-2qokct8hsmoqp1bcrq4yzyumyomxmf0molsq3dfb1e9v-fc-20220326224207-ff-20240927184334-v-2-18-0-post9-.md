description: Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 1 (MAP4K1) is a
  serine/threonine kinase that acts as an immune checkpoint downstream of T-cell receptor
  stimulation. MAP4K1 activity is enhanced by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and transforming
  growth factor beta (TGFβ), immune modulators commonly present in the tumor microenvironment.
  Therefore, its pharmacological inhibition is an attractive immuno-oncology concept
  for inducing therapeutic T-cell responses in cancer patients. Here, we ...
