description: Efficient and accurate nanocarrier development for targeted drug delivery
  is hindered by a lack of methods to analyze its cell-level biodistribution across
  whole organisms. Here we present Single Cell Precision Nanocarrier Identification
  (SCP-Nano), an integrated experimental and deep learning pipeline to comprehensively
  quantify the targeting of nanocarriers throughout the whole mouse body at single-cell
  resolution. SCP-Nano reveals the tissue distribution patterns of lipid nanoparticles
