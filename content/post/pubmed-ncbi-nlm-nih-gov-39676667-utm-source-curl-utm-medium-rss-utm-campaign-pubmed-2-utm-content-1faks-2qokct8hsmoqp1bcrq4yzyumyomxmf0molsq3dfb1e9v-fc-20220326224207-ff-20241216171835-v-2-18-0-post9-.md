description: Light-controlled transcriptional activation is a commonly used optogenetic
  strategy that allows researchers to regulate gene expression with high spatiotemporal
  precision. The vast majority of existing tools are, however, limited to light-triggered
  induction of gene expression. Here, we inverted this mode of action and created
  optogenetic systems capable of efficiently terminating transcriptional activation
  in response to blue light. First, we designed highly compact regulators ...
