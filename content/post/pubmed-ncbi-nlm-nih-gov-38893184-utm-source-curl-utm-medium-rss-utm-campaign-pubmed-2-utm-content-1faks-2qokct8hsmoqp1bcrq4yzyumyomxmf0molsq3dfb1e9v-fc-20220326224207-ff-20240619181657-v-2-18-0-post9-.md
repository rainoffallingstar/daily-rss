description: In the context of breast cancer treatment optimization, this study prospectively
  examines the feasibility and outcomes of utilizing intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT)
  as a boost in combination with standard external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for high-risk
  patients. Different guidelines recommend such a tumor bed boost in addition to whole
  breast irradiation with EBRT for patients with risk factors for local breast cancer
  recurrence. The TARGIT BQR (NCT01440010) is a prospective, ...
