description: Phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) facilitate the discovery of
  associations between a single genetic variant with multiple phenotypes. For variants
  which impact a specific protein, this can help identify additional therapeutic indications
  or on-target side effects of intervening on that protein. However, PheWAS is restricted
  by an inability to distinguish confounding due to linkage disequilibrium (LD) from
  true pleiotropy. Here we describe CoPheScan (Coloc adapted Phenome-wide Scan), ...
