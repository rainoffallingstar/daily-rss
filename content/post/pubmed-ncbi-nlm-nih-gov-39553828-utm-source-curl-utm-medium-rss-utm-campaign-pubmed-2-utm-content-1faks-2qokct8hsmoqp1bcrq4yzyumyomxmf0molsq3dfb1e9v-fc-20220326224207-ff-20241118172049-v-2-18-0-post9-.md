description: Processing of auditory signals critically depends on the neuron's ability
  to fire brief, precisely timed action potentials (APs) at high frequencies and high
  fidelity for prolonged times. This requires the expression of specialized sets of
  ion channels to quickly repolarize neurons, prevent aberrant AP firing and tightly
  regulate neuronal excitability. Although critically important, the regulation of
  neuronal excitability has received little attention in the auditory system. ...
