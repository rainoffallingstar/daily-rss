description: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy has emerged as a powerful
  weapon in the fight against cancer. However, its efficacy is often hindered by challenges
  such as limited tumor penetration, antigen escape, and immune suppression within
  the tumor microenvironment. This review explores the potential of armored CAR-T
  cells, or 'micropharmacies', in overcoming these obstacles and enhancing the therapeutic
  outcomes of adoptive T-cell (ATC) therapy. We delve into the engineering ...
