description: Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and endovascular therapy (EVT) are the
  cornerstones of acute ischemic stroke treatment. While IVT has been an integral
  part of acute therapy since the mid-1990s, EVT has evolved as one of the most effective
  treatments in medicine over the past decade. Traditionally, systemic thrombolysis
  has been performed with alteplase (rtPA). More recently, tenecteplase (TNK) has
  been shown to be non-inferior to rtPA. TNK has some pharmacological advantages over
  rtPA and ...
