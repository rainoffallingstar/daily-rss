description: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only
  established curative option for Fanconi anemia (FA) associated bone marrow failure
  (BMF)/aplastic anemia (AA) and hematological malignancy. We performed a retrospective
  multicenter study on 813 FA children undergoing first HSCT between 2010 and 2018.
  Median duration of follow-up was 3.7 years (interquartile range, 3.4-4.0). Median
