description: Bruch´s membrane (BM) is firmly connected posteriorly to the optic nerve
  head through the peripapillary choroidal border tissue, and anteriorly through the
  longitudinal ciliary muscle to the scleral spur. We assessed, whether a difference
  in the contractile state of the ciliary muscle influences the position of the posterior
  BM by lifting the posterior BM pole, i.e., induces changes in the subfoveal choroidal
  thickness (SFCT). Healthy young adult individuals received one drop of ...
