description: One way cells control the speed and specificity of protein degradation
  is by regulating the activity of ubiquitin ligases. Upon proteotoxic stress in yeast,
  the intrinsically disordered protein Roq1 binds the ubiquitin ligase Ubr1 as a pseudosubstrate,
  thereby modulating the degradation of substrates of the N-degron pathway and promoting
  the elimination of misfolded proteins. The mechanism underlying this reprograming
  of Ubr1 is unknown. Here, we show that Roq1 controls Ubr1 by means of ...
