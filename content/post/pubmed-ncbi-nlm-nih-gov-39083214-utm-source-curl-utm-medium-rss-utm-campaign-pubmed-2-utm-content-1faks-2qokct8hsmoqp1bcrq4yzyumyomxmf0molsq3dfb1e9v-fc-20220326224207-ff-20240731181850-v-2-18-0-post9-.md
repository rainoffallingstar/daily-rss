description: The Woven EndoBridge (WEB) device is primarily used for treating wide-neck
  intracranial bifurcation aneurysms under 10 mm. Limited data exists on its efficacy
  for large aneurysms. We aim to assess angiographic and clinical outcomes of the
  WEB device in treating large versus small aneurysms. We conducted a retrospective
  review of the WorldWide WEB Consortium database, from 2011 to 2022, across 30 academic
