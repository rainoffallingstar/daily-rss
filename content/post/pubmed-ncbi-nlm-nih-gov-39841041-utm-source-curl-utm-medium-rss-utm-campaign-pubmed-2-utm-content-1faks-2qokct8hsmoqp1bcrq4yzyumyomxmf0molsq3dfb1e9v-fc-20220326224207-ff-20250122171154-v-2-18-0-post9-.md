description: Recent evidence highlights that monetary rewards can increase the precision
  at which healthy human volunteers can detect small changes in the intensity of thermal
  noxious stimuli, contradicting the idea that rewards exert a broad inhibiting influence
  on pain perception. This effect was stronger with contingent rewards compared with
  noncontingent rewards, suggesting a successful learning process. In the present
