description: Perturbations in intermediary metabolism contribute to the pathogenesis
  of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and can produce therapeutically actionable dependencies.
  Here, we probed whether alpha-ketoglutarate (aKG) metabolism represents a specific
  vulnerability in AML. Using functional genomics, metabolomics, and mouse models,
  we identified the aKG dehydrogenase complex, which catalyzes the conversion of aKG
  to succinyl CoA, as a molecular dependency across multiple models of adverse-risk
