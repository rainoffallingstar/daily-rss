description: Platelets contribute to a variety of physiological processes including
  inflammation, sepsis and cancer. However, due to their primary role in hemostasis,
  platelet transfusions are largely restricted to managing thrombocytopenia and bleeding.
  One way to expand the utility of platelet transfusions would be to genetically engineer
  donor platelets with new or enhanced functions. We have previously shown that lipid
  nanoparticles containing mRNA (mRNA-LNP) can be used to genetically modify ...
