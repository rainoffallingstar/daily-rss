description: Calculations of the two-loop electron self-energy for the 1S Lamb shift
  are reported, performed to all orders in the nuclear binding strength parameter
  Zα (where Z is the nuclear charge number and α is the fine structure constant).
  Our approach allows calculations to be extended to nuclear charges lower than previously
  possible and improves the numerical accuracy by more than an order of magnitude.
  Extrapolation of our all-order results to hydrogen yields a result twice as precise
  as ...
