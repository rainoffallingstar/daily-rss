description: Nectin-4 is a cell-adhesion molecule expressed at various levels in many
  solid tumors, including urothelial cancer. As means to reduce on-target skin toxicity
  observed with enfortumab vedotin, an anti-nectin-4-MMAE ADC approved for patients
  with advanced urothelial cancer, 15A7.5, an anti-nectin-4 monoclonal antibody that
  exhibited differential nectin-4 binding between tumor and primary keratinocytes,
  was selected for the development of ETx-22. Exatecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor,
