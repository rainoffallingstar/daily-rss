description: Combined ^(23)Na/^(39)K MRI at 7 T can highlight ion disturbances in
  skeletal muscle tissue. In this work, we investigated if the apparent tissue potassium
  concentration (aTPC) can be determined in fatty replaced muscles of patients with
  facio-scapulo-humeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) and if it can provide additional
  information to the fat replacement and the apparent tissue sodium concentration
  (aTSC). The lower leg of 14 patients (six females, eight males; mean age 47.7 ±
  14.0 years) ...
