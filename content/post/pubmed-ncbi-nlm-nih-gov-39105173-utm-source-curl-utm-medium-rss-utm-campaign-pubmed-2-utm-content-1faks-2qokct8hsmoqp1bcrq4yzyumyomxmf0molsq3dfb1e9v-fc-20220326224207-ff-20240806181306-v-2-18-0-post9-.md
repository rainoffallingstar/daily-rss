description: While spatial transcriptomics has undeniably revolutionized our ability
  to study cellular organization, it has driven the development of a great number
  of innovative transcriptomics methods, which can be classified into in situ sequencing
  (ISS) methods, in situ hybridization (ISH) techniques, and next-generation sequencing
  (NGS)-based sequencing with region capture. These technologies not only refine our
  understanding of cellular processes, but also open up new possibilities for breakthroughs
