description: 'CONCLUSIONS: In summary, miR-1307-5p reduces angiogenesis in breast
  cancer, thereby antagonizing the oncogenic effects of miR-1307-3p. Our results emphasize
  the importance of future research on the regulation of miRNA arm selection in cancer.
  The underlying mechanisms might inspire new therapeutic strategies aimed at shifting
  the balance towards tumor-suppressive miRNA ...'
