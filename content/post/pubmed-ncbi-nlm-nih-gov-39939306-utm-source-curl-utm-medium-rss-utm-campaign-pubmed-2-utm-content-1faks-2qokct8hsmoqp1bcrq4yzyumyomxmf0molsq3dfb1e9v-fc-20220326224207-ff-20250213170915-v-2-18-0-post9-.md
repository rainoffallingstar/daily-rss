description: In multicellular systems, the migration pattern of individual cells critically
  relies on the interactions with neighboring cells. Depending on the strength of
  these interactions, cells either move as a collective, as observed during morphogenesis
  and wound healing, or migrate individually, as it is the case for immune cells and
  fibroblasts. Mediators of cell-cell adhesions, such as cadherins coordinate collective
  dynamics by linking the cytoskeleton of neighboring cells. However, ...
