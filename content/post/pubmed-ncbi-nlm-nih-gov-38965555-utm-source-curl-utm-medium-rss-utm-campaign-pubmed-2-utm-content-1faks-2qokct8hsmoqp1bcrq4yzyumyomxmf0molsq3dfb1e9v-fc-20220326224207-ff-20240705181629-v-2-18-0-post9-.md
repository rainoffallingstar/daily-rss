description: 'CONCLUSIONS: Endurance- compared to resistance-trained athletes and
  untrained individuals demonstrated a different DNA methylation signature of selected
  skeletal muscle genes, which may influence transcriptional dynamics following a
  bout of acute exercise. Skeletal muscle fiber type distribution is associated with
  methylation of fiber type specific genes. Our results suggest that the baseline
  DNA methylation landscape in skeletal muscle influences the transcription of regulatory
  genes ...'
