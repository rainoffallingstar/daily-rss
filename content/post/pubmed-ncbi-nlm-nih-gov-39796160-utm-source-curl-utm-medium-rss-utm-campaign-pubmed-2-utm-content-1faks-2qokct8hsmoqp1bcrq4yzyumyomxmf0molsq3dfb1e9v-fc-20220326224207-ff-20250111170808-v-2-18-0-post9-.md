description: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer
  deaths due to its late diagnosis and restricted therapeutic options. Therefore,
  the search for appropriate alternatives to commonly applied therapies remains an
  area of high clinical need. Here we investigated the therapeutic potential of the
  glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) inhibitor Genz-123346 and the cationic amphiphilic
  drug aripiprazole on the inhibition of Huh7 and Hepa 1-6 hepatocellular cancer cell
  and ...
