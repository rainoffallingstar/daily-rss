description: In the 100 years since Dr. Eli Moschcowitz reported the first case of
  thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), there has been remarkable awareness and
  progress in the diagnosis and management of this rare blood disorder. This progress
  initially was the result of careful clinical observations followed by well thought-out
  therapeutic interventions, with dual goals of both improving outcomes and discerning
  the pathophysiology of TTP. The discovery of the ADAMTS13 protease set in motion
