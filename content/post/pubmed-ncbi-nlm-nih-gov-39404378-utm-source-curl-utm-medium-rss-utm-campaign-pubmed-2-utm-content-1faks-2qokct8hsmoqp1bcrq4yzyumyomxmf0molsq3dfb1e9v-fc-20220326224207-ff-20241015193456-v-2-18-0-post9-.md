description: Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is primarily categorized into basal cell
  carcinoma (BCC), the most prevalent form of skin cancer, and cutaneous squamous
  cell carcinoma (cSCC), the second most common type. Both BCC and cSCC represent
  a significant health burden, particularly in immunocompromised individuals and the
  elderly. The immune system plays a pivotal role in the development and progression
  of NMSC, making it a critical focus for therapeutic interventions. This review highlights
