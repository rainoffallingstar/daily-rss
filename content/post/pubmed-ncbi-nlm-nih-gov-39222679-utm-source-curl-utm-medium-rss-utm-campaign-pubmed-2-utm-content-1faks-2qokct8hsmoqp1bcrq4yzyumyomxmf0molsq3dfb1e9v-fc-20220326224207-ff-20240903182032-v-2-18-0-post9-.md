description: The highly conserved Hsp90 chaperones control stability and activity
  of many essential signaling and regulatory proteins including many protein kinases,
  E3 ligases and transcription factors. Thereby, Hsp90s couple cellular homeostasis
  of the proteome to cell fate decisions. High-throughput mass spectrometry revealed
  178 and 169 posttranslational modifications (PTMs) for human cytosolic Hsp90α and
  Hsp90β, but for only a few of the modifications the physiological consequences are
  investigated ...
