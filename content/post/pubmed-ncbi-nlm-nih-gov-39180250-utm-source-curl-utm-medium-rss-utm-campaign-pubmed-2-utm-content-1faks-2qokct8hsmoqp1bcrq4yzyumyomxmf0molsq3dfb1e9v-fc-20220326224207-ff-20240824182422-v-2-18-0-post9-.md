description: R-spondins (RSPOs) are a family of secreted proteins and stem cell growth
  factors that are potent co-activators of Wnt signaling. Recently, RSPO2 and RSPO3
  were shown to be multifunctional, not only amplifying Wnt- but also binding BMP-
  and FGF receptors to downregulate signaling. The common mechanism underlying these
  diverse functions is that RSPO2 and RSPO3 act as "endocytosers" that link transmembrane
  proteins to ZNRF3/RNF43 E3 ligases and trigger target internalization. Thus, RSPOs
