description: We investigated the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of Lacticaseibacillus
  rhamnosus Ram12-derived EPSRam12 in a D-galactose-induced liver injury mouse model.
  Initially, EPSRam12 was characterized for its composition, molecular weight, and
  structural features. It was then administered orally to D-galactose-induced mice
  (which had received an intraperitoneal injection of D-galactose, 100 mg/kg body
  weight) at doses of 25 mg/kg (low dose) and 50 mg/kg (high dose) for 45 days. ...
