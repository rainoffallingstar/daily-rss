description: Heat stress can lead to protein misfolding and aggregation, potentially
  causing cell death due to the loss of essential proteins. Bacteria, being particularly
  exposed to environmental stress, are equipped with disaggregases that rescue these
  aggregated proteins. The bacterial Hsp70 chaperone DnaK and the ATPase associated
  with diverse cellular activities protein ClpB form the canonical disaggregase in
  bacteria. While this combination operates effectively during physiological heat
  stress, it ...
