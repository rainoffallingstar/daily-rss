description: Early recognition of hereditary urological cancers may influence diagnostic
  and therapeutic decision-making, and potentially alter the fate of patients and
  family members. Here, we introduce readers to the current knowledge on germline
  genetic testing and clinical practice in prostate, bladder, renal, and testicular
