description: Discontinuation of lenalidomide maintenance post autologous transplantation
  (ASCT) is a burning question within the myeloma (MM) community, especially after
  the inclusion of MRD in the disease response criteria. In this prospective study,
  we evaluated the conversion to MRD positivity, the treatment-free survival (TFS)
  and the progression-free survival (PFS) in 52 MM patients, who discontinued lenalidomide
  maintenance, after achievement of sustained bone marrow and imaging MRD negativity
