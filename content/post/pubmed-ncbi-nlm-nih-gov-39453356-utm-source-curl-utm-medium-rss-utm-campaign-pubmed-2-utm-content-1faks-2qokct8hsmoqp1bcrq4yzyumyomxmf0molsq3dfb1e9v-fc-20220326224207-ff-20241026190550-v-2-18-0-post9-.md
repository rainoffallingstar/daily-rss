description: Dual agonism of glucagon and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors
  may be more effective than GLP-1 receptor agonism alone in reducing body weight,
  but the cardiovascular (CV) effects are unknown. The authors describe the rationale
  and design of SYNCHRONIZE-CVOT, a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,
  event-driven, CV safety study of survodutide, a dual glucagon and GLP-1 receptor
  agonist, administered subcutaneously once weekly compared with placebo in adults
