description: Genetic variation at the 19q13.3 KLK locus is linked with prostate cancer
  susceptibility in men. The non-synonymous KLK3 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),
  rs17632542 (c.536 T > C; Ile163Thr-substitution in PSA) is associated with reduced
  prostate cancer risk, however, the functional relevance is unknown. Here, we identify
  that the SNP variant-induced change in PSA biochemical activity mediates prostate
  cancer pathogenesis. The 'Thr' PSA variant leads to small subcutaneous tumours,
