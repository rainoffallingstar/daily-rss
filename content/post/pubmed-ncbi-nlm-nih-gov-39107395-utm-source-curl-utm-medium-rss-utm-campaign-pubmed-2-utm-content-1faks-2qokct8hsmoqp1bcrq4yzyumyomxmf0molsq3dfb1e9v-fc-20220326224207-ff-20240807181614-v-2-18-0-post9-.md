description: Identification of Aedes aegypti breeding hotspots is essential for the
  implementation of targeted vector control strategies and thus the prevention of
  several mosquito-borne diseases worldwide. Training computer vision models on satellite
  and street view imagery in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro, we analyzed the correlation
  between the density of common breeding grounds and Aedes aegypti infestation measured
  by ovitraps on a monthly basis between 2019 and 2022. Our findings emphasized ...
