  chronic disorder characterized by expansion of either T- or NK- cytotoxic cells.
  Contrary to EBV-induced aggressive NK-LGL leukemia, chronic T- and NK-LGL leukemia
  are indolent diseases affecting elderly patients with a median age of 66.5 years
  old. LGL leukemia is frequently associated with autoimmune disorders, most frequently
  rheumatoid arthritis. An auto/allo antigen is tentatively implicated in disease
