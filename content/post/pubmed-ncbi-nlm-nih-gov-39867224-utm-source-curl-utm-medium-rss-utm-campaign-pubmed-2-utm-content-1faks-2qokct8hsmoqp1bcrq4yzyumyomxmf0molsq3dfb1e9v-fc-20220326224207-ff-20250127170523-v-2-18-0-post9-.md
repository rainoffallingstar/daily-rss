description: Two-pore channels (TPCs) are adenine nucleotide and phosphoinositide
  regulated cation channels. NAADP activates and ATP blocks TPCs, while the endolysosomal
  phosphoinositide PI(3,5)P(2) activates TPCs. TPCs are ubiquitously expressed including
  expression in the innate as well as the adaptive immune system. In the immune system
  TPCs are found, e.g. in macrophages, mast cells and T cells. In cytotoxic T cells,
  NAADP activates TPCs on cytolytic granules to stimulate exocytosis and killing.
