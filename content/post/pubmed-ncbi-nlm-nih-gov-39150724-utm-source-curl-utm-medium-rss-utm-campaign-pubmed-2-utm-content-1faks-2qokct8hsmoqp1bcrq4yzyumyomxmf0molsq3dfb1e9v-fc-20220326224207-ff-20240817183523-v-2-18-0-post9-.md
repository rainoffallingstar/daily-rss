description: The term "glycation compounds" comprises a wide range of structurally
  diverse compounds that are formed endogenously and in food via the Maillard reaction,
  a chemical reaction between reducing sugars and amino acids. Glycation compounds
  produced endogenously are considered to contribute to a range of diseases. This
  has led to the hypothesis that glycation compounds present in food may also cause
  adverse effects and thus pose a nutritional risk to human health. In this work,
  the Senate ...
