description: Protein-ligand interactions (PLIs) determine the efficacy and safety
  profiles of small molecule drugs. Existing methods rely on either structural information
  or resource-intensive computations to predict PLI, casting doubt on whether it is
  possible to perform structure-free PLI predictions at low computational cost. Here
  we show that a light-weight graph neural network (GNN), trained with quantitative
  PLIs of a small number of proteins and ligands, is able to predict the strength
