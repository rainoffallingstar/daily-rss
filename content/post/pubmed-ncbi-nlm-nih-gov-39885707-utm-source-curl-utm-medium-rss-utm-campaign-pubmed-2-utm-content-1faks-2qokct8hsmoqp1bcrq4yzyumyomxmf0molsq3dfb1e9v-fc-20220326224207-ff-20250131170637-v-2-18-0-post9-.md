description: Fully bay-aminated octaazaperopyrenedioxide (OAPPDO) derivatives have
  been accessible via Buchwald-Hartwig amination of the bay-chlorinated starting material.
  They were isolated as semiquinoidal species with a bent polycyclic core and characterized
  as nonfluorescent charge-transfer dyes. The corresponding secondary amines were
  synthesized by reduction and displayed typical absorption and emission behavior
  for perylene derivatives. One of the reduced amines served as a precursor for conversion
