description: The immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment poses a significant
  challenge to effective immunotherapies against glioblastoma (GB). Boosting the immune
  response is critical for successful therapy. Here, we adopted a cancer gene therapy
  approach to induce T-cell-mediated killing of the tumor through increased activation
  of the immune system. Patient-based three-dimensional (3D) GB models were infected
  with a replication-deficient adenovirus (AdV) armed with the class II ...
