description: A search for the exclusive hadronic decays W^{±}→π^{±}γ, W^{±}→K^{±}γ,
  and W^{±}→ρ^{±}γ is performed using up to 140 fb^{-1} of proton-proton collisions
  recorded with the ATLAS detector at a center-of-mass energy of sqrt[s]=13 TeV. If
  observed, these rare processes would provide a unique test bench for the quantum
  chromodynamics factorization formalism used to calculate cross sections at colliders.
  Additionally, at future colliders, these decays could offer a new way to measure
  the W boson ...
