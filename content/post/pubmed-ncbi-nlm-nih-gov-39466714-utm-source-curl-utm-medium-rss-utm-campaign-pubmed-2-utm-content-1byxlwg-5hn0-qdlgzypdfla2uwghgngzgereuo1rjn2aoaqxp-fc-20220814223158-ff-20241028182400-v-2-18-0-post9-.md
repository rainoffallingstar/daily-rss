description: Peptide drugs play an essential role in modern therapeutics, but the
  computational design of these molecules is hindered by several challenges. Traditional
  methods like molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, as well as
  recent deep learning approaches, often face limitations related to computational
  resource demands, complex binding affinity assessments, extensive data requirements,
  and poor model interpretability. Here, we introduce PepHiRe, an innovative methodology
