description: 'BACKGROUND: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is initially highly sensitive
  to chemotherapy, which often leads to significant tumor reduction. However, the
  majority of patients eventually develop resistance, and the disease is further complicated
  by its "cold" tumor microenvironment, characterized by low tumor immunogenicity
  and limited CD8+ T cell infiltration. These factors contribute to the poor response
