description: Medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) is a powerful model to study genetics underlying
  the developmental and functional traits of the vertebrate visual system. We established
  a simple and high-throughput optomotor response (OMR) assay utilizing medaka larvae
  to study visual functions including visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. Our
  assay presents multiple adjustable stripes in motion to individual fish in a linear
  arena. For that the OMR assay employs a tablet display and the Fish Stripes ...
