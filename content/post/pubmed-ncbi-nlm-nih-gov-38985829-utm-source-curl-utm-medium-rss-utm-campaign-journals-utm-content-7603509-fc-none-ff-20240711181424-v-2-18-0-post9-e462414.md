  of hematopoiesis, providing intricate details about hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)
  biology, differentiation, and lineage commitment. Technological advancements have
  highlighted extensive heterogeneity of cell populations and continuity of differentiation
  routes. Nevertheless, intermediate 'attractor' states signify structure in stem
  and progenitor populations that link state transition dynamics to fate potential.
