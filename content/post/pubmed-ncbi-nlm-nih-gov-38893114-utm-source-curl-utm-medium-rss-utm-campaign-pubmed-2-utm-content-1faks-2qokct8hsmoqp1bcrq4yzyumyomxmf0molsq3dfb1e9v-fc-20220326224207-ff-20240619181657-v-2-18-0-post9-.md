description: Helium ion therapy (HRT) is a promising modality for the treatment of
  pediatric tumors and those located close to critical structures due to the favorable
  biophysical properties of helium ions. This in silico study aimed to explore the
  potential benefits of HRT in advanced juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA)
  compared to proton therapy (PRT). We assessed 11 consecutive patients previously
  treated with PRT for JNA in a definitive or postoperative setting with a relative
