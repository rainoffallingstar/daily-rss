description: Pathologic α-synuclein (α-syn) spreads from cell-to-cell, in part, through
  binding to the lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (Lag3). Here we report that amyloid
  β precursor-like protein 1 (Aplp1) interacts with Lag3 that facilitates the binding,
  internalization, transmission, and toxicity of pathologic α-syn. Deletion of both
  Aplp1 and Lag3 eliminates the loss of dopaminergic neurons and the accompanying
  behavioral deficits induced by α-syn preformed fibrils (PFF). Anti-Lag3 prevents
