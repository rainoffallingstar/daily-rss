description: Introduction The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is crucial for bone formation
  and remodeling, regulating osteoblast differentiation, bone remodeling, and skeletal
  homeostasis. Dysregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is linked to bone-related
  diseases like osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and osteosarcoma. The strategies to
  modulate this pathway include Wnt agonists, inhibitors, and small molecules. Graph
