description: Unhealthy eating, a risk factor for eating disorders (EDs) and obesity,
  often coexists with emotional and behavioral problems; however, the underlying neurobiological
  mechanisms are poorly understood. Analyzing data from the longitudinal IMAGEN adolescent
  cohort, we investigated associations between eating behaviors, genetic predispositions
  for high body mass index (BMI) using polygenic scores (PGSs), and trajectories (ages
  14-23 years) of ED-related psychopathology and brain ...
