description: The growing availability of single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics
  has led to the development of many approaches to infer cell-cell communication,
  each capturing only a partial view of the complex landscape of intercellular signalling.
  Here we present LIANA+, a scalable framework built around a rich knowledge base
  to decode coordinated inter- and intracellular signalling events from single- and
