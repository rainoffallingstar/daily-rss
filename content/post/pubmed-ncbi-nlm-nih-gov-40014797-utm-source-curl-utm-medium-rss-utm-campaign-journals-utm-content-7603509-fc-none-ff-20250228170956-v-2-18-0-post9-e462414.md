description: While the bone marrow is the main site of blood cell production in adults,
  rare pools of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells have been found in extramedullary
  organs. In mice, we have previously shown that the lungs contain hematopoietic progenitor
  cells and is a site of platelet production. Here, in the adult human lung, we show
  that functional hematopoietic precursors reside in the extravascular spaces with
  a frequency similar to the bone marrow, and are capable of proliferation ...
