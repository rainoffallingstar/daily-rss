description: Structural neuroimaging data have been used to compute an estimate of
  the biological age of the brain (brain-age) which has been associated with other
  biologically and behaviorally meaningful measures of brain development and aging.
  The ongoing research interest in brain-age has highlighted the need for robust and
  publicly available brain-age models pre-trained on data from large samples of healthy
