description: DNA methylation (DNAm) is a key epigenetic mark that shows profound alterations
  in cancer. Read-level methylomes enable more in-depth analyses, due to their broad
  genomic coverage and preservation of rare cell-type signals, compared to summarized
  data such as 450K/EPIC microarrays. Here, we propose MethylBERT, a Transformer-based
  model for read-level methylation pattern classification. MethylBERT identifies tumour-derived
