description: DNA nanotechnology is a powerful synthetic approach to crafting diverse
  nanostructures through self-assembly. Chemical decoration of such nanostructures
  is often required to tailor their properties for specific applications. In this
  Letter, we introduce a pioneering method to direct the assembly and enable the functionalization
  of DNA nanostructures using an azide-bearing functional polyamine. We first demonstrate
  the successful polyamine-assisted folding of a scaffolded DNA ...
