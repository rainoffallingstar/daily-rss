description: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a dismal disease with poor prognosis,
  particularly in the relapsed/refractory (r/r) setting. Chimeric antigen receptor
  (CAR) therapy has yielded remarkable clinical results in other leukemias and thus
  has, in principle, the potential to achieve similar outcomes in r/r AML. Re-directing
  the approved CD19-specific CAR designs against the myeloid antigens CD33, CD123
  or CLEC12A has occasionally yielded morphological leukemia-free states (MLFS) but
  has so ...
