description: Aseptic implant loosening is the primary cause of revisions in arthroplasty.
  Various in vitro and in vivo methods are available for assessing implant fixation
  and stability. The aim of the Musculoskeletal Biomechanics Research Network (MSB-NET)
  is to continuously improve or develop these methods. In vitro analyses are often
  conducted using static and dynamic ISO and ASTM standards, while RSA, DXA, and EBRA
  analyses are established in vivo methods for evaluating implant fixation. ...
