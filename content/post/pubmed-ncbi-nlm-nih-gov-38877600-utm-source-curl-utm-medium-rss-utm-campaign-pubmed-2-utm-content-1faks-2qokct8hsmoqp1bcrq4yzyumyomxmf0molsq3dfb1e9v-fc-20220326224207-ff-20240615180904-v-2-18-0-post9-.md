description: MYC dysregulation is pivotal in the onset and progression of IDH-mutant
  gliomas, mostly driven by copy-number alterations, regulatory element alterations,
  or epigenetic changes. Our pilot analysis uncovered instances of relative MYC overexpression
  without alterations in the proximal MYC network (PMN), prompting a deeper investigation
  into potential novel oncogenic mechanisms. Analysing comprehensive genomics profiles
  of 236 "IDH-mutant 1p/19q non-co-deleted" lower-grade gliomas from The ...
