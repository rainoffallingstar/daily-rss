description: Neoantigen vaccines are under investigation for various cancers, including
  epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-driven lung cancers^(1,2). We tracked the
  phylogenetic history of an EGFR mutant lung cancer treated with erlotinib, osimertinib,
  radiotherapy and a personalized neopeptide vaccine (NPV) targeting ten somatic mutations,
  including EGFR exon 19 deletion (ex19del). The ex19del mutation was clonal, but
  is likely to have appeared after a whole-genome doubling (WGD) event. ...
