description: Cell nuclei interpretation is crucial in pathological diagnostics, especially
  in tumor specimens. A critical step in computational pathology is to detect and
  analyze individual nuclear properties using segmentation algorithms. Conventionally,
  a semantic segmentation network is used, where individual nuclear properties are
  derived after post-processing a segmentation mask. In this study, we focus on showing
  that an object-detection-based instance segmentation network, the Mask R-CNN, ...
