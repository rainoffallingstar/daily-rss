description: The functions of integrins are tightly regulated via multiple mechanisms
  including trafficking and degradation. Integrins are repeatedly internalized, routed
  into the endosomal system and either degraded by the lysosome or recycled back to
  the plasma membrane. The ubiquitin system dictates whether internalized proteins
  are degraded or recycled. Here, we use a genetic screen and proximity-dependent
  biotin identification to identify deubiquitinase(s) that control integrin surface
  levels. We ...
