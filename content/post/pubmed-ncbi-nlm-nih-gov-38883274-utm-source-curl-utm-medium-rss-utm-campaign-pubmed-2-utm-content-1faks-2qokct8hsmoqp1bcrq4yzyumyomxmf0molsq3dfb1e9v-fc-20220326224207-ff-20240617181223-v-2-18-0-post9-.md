description: 'CONCLUSIONS: Fresh dissected whole-mount tissue can be stained using
  direct exposure to selected antibody clones. Several antibody clones were identified
  that provided excellent immunofluorescence imaging of labeled structures, such as
  endothelial, epithelial, or EGFR-expressing cells. The combination of in situ immunofluorescence
  staining and fiber-optic microscopy visualizes structures in vital tissues and could
  be proposed as an useful tool for the in situ identification of residual ...'
