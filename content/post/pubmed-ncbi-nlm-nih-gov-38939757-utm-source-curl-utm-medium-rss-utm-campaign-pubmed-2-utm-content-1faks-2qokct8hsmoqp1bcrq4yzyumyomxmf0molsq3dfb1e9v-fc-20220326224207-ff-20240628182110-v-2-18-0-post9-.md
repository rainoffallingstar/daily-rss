description: Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) microscopy is a nonlinear all-optical
  imaging method that provides mechanical contrast based on the interaction of laser
  radiation and acoustical vibrational modes. Featuring high mechanical specificity
  and sensitivity, three-dimensional sectioning, and practical imaging times, SBS
  microscopy with (quasi) continuous wave excitation is rapidly advancing as a promising
  imaging tool for label-free visualization of viscoelastic information of materials
