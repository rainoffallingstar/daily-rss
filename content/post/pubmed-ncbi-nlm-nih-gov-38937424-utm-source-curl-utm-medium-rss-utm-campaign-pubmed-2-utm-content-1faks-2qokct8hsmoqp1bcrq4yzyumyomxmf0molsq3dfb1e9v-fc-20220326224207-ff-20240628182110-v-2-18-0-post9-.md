description: 'The focus of the present article is not on failures to replicate but
  on the more optimistically framed and more fruitful question: What stable findings
  can be reproduced reliably and can be trusted by decision makers, managers, health
  agents, or politicians? We propagate the working hypothesis that a twofold key to
  stable and replicable findings lies in the existence of theoretical constraints
  and, no less important, in researchers'' sensitivity to metatheoretical, auxiliary
  assumptions. ...'
