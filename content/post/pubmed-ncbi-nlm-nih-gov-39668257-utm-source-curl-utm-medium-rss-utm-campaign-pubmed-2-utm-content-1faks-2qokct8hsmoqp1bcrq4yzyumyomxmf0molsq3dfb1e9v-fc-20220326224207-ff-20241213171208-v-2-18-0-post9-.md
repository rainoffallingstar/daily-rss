description: Ribosome-targeting antibiotics represent an important class of antimicrobial
  drugs. Chloramphenicol (Cm) is a well-studied ribosomal peptidyl transferase center
  (PTC) binder and growing evidence suggests that its inhibitory action depends on
  the sequence of the nascent peptide. How such selective inhibition on the molecular
  scale manifests on the cellular level remains unclear. Here, we use cryo-electron
  tomography to analyze the impact of Cm inside the bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
