description: The integrative multi-kingdom interaction of the gut microbiome in ulcerative
  colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) remains underinvestigated. Here, we perform
  shotgun metagenomic sequencing of feces from patients with UC and CD, and healthy
  controls in the Japanese 4D cohort, profiling bacterial taxa, gene functions, and
  antibacterial genes, bacteriophages, and fungi. External metagenomic datasets from
  the US, Spain, the Netherlands, and China were analyzed to validate our multi-biome
