  (CC) elimination (ie, <4 cases per 100,000 women) in the United States may mask
  potential disparities in achieving elimination among sub-populations. We used three
  independent Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) models
  to estimate differences in the time to CC elimination across seven strata of correlated
  screening and human papillomavirus vaccination uptake, based on national survey
