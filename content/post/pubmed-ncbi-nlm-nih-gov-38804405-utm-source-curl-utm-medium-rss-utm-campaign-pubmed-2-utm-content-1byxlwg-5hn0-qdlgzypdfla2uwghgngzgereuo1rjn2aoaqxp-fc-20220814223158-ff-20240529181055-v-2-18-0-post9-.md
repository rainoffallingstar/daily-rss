description: Tatton-Brown-Rahman syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant hereditary
  disease caused by pathogenic variants in the DNMT3A gene, which is an important
  participant in epigenetic regulation, especially during embryonic development, and
  is highly expressed in all tissues. The main features of the syndrome are high growth,
  macrocephaly, intellectual disability, and facial dysmorphic features. We present
  a clinical case of Tatton-Brown-Rahman syndrome in a ten-year-old boy with macrocephaly
