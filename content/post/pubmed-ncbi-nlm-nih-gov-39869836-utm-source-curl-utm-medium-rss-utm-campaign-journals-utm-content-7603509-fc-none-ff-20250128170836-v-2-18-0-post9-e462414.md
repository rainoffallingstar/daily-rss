description: In thrombosis and hemostasis, the formation of a platelet-fibrin thrombus
  or clot is a highly controlled process that varies, depending on the pathological
  context. Major signaling pathways in platelets are well established. However, studies
  with genetically modified mice have identified the contribution of hundreds of additional
  platelet-expressed proteins in arterial thrombus formation and bleeding. Using phenotype
  information of 540 mouse genes, involved in arterial thrombosis and ...
