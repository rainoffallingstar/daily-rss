description: We report a fully differential study of ionization of the Ne L shell
  by Compton scattering of 20 keV photons. We find two physical mechanisms that modify
  the Compton-electron emission. Firstly, we observe scattering of the Compton electrons
  at their parent nucleus. Secondly, we find a distinct maximum in the electron momentum
  distribution close-to-zero momentum that we attribute to a focusing of the electrons
  by the Coulomb ...
