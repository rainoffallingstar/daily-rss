description: Testicular large B-cell lymphoma (TLBCL) is an infrequent and aggressive
  lymphoma arising in an immune-privileged site and has recently been recognized as
  a distinct entity from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We describe the genetic
  features of TLBCL and compare them with published series of nodal DLBCL and primary
  large B-cell lymphomas of the CNS (PCNSL). We collected 61 patients with TLBCL.
  We performed targeted next-generation sequencing, copy number arrays, and fluorescent
  in ...
