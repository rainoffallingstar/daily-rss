description: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major human pathogen and can cause a range
  of conditions from asymptomatic colonization to invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD).
  The epidemiology and distribution of IPD-causing serotypes in Australia has undergone
  large changes following the introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate
  vaccine (PCV) in 2005 and the 13-valent PCV in 2011. In this study, to provide a
  contemporary understanding of the IPD causing population in Victoria, Australia,
