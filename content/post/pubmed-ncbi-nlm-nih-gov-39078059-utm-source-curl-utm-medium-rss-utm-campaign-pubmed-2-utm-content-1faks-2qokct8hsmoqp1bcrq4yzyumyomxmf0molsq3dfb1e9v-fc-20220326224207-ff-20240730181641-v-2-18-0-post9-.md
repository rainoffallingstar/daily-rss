description: Lithium-rich antiperovskites promise to be a compelling class of high-capacity
  cathode materials due to the existence of both cationic and anionic redox activity.
  Little is however known about the effect of separating the electrochemical cationic
  process from the anionic process and the associated implications on the electrochemical
  performance. In this context, we report the electrochemical properties of the illustrative
  example of three different (Li(2)Fe)SO materials with a focus ...
