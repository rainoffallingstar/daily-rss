description: Loss of long-term hematopoietic stem cell (LT-HSC) function ex vivo hampers
  the success of clinical protocols reliant on culture. However, the kinetics and
  mechanisms by which this occurs remain incompletely characterized. Here, through
  time-resolved scRNA-Seq, matched in vivo functional analysis and the use of a reversible
  in vitro system of early G1 arrest, we define the sequence of transcriptional and
  functional events occurring during the first ex vivo division of human LT-HSCs.
