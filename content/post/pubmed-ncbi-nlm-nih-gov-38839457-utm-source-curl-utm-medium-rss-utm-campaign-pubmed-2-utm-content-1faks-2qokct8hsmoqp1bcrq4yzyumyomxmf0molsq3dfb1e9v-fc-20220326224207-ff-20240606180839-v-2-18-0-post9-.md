description: The Eµ-TCL1 mouse model has been used for over 20 years to study the
  pathobiology of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and for preclinical testing of
  novel therapies. A CLL-like disease develops with increasing age in these mice due
  to a B cell specific overexpression of human TCL1. The reliability of this model
  to mirror human CLL is controversially discussed, as none of the known driver mutations
  identified in patients are found in Eµ-TCL1 mice. It has to be acknowledged that
