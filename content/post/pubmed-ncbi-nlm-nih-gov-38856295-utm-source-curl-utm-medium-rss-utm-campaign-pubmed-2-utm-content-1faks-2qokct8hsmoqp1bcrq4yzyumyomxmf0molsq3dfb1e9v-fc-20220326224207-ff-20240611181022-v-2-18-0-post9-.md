description: We show that the same QCD formalism that accounts for the suppression
  of high-p_{T} hadron and jet spectra in heavy-ion collisions predicts medium-enhanced
  production of cc[over ¯] pairs in jets. We demonstrate that this phenomenon, which
  cannot be accessed by traditional jet-quenching observables, can be directly observed
  using D^{0}D[over ¯]^{0}-tagged jets in nuclear ...
