description: In 1982, the RAS genes HRAS and KRAS were discovered as the first human
  cancer genes, with KRAS later identified as one of the most frequently mutated oncogenes.
  Yet, it took nearly 40 years to develop clinically effective inhibitors for RAS-mutant
  cancers. The discovery in 2013 by Shokat and colleagues of a druggable pocket in
  KRAS paved the way to FDA approval of the first covalently binding KRAS^(G12C) inhibitors,
  sotorasib and adagrasib, in 2021 and 2022, respectively. However, rather ...
