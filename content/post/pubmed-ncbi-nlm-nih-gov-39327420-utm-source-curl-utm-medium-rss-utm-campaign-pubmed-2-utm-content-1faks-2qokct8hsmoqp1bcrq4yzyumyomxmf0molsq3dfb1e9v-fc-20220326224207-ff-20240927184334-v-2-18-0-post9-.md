  powerful approach to obtain deep proteome coverage, and has gained recent traction
  for label-free analysis of single cells. However, optimal experimental design for
  DIA-based single-cell proteomics has not been fully explored, and performance metrics
  of subsequent data analysis tools remain to be evaluated. Therefore, we here formalize
