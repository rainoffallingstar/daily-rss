description: Despite advances in precision oncology, clinical decision-making still
  relies on limited variables and expert knowledge. To address this limitation, we
  combined multimodal real-world data and explainable artificial intelligence (xAI)
  to introduce AI-derived (AID) markers for clinical decision support. We used xAI
  to decode the outcome of 15,726 patients across 38 solid cancer entities based on
  350 markers, including clinical records, image-derived body compositions, and mutational
