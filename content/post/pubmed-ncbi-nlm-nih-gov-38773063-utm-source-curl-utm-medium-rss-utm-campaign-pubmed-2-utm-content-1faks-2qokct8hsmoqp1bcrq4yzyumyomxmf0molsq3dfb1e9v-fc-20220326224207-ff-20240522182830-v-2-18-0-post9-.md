description: Within the thymus, thymic epithelial cells (TECs) create dedicated microenvironments
  for T cell development and selection. Considering that TECs are sensitive to distinct
  pathophysiological conditions, uncovering the molecular elements that coordinate
  their thymopoietic role has important fundamental and clinical implications. Particularly,
  medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) play a crucial role in central tolerance.
  Our previous studies, along with others, suggest that mTECs depend ...
