description: Recent studies have highlighted neurons and their associated Schwann
  cells (SCs) as key regulators of cancer development. However, the mode of their
  interaction with tumor cells or other components of the tumor microenvironment (TME)
  remains elusive. We established an SC-related 43-gene set as a surrogate for peripheral
  nerves in the TME. Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) from The Cancer
  Genome Atlas (TCGA) were classified into low, intermediate and high SC score groups
  based on ...
