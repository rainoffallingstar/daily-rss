description: One of the most fundamental laws of physics is the principle of least
  action. Motivated by its predictive power, we introduce a neuronal least-action
  principle for cortical processing of sensory streams to produce appropriate behavioral
  outputs in real time. The principle postulates that the voltage dynamics of cortical
  pyramidal neurons prospectively minimizes the local somato-dendritic mismatch error
  within individual neurons. For output neurons, the principle implies minimizing
