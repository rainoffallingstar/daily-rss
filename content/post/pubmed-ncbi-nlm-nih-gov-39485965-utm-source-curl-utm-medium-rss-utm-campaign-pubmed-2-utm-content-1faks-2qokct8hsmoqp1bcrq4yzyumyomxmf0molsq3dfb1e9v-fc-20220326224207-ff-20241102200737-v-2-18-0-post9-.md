description: A search for long-lived particles (LLPs) using 140 fb^{-1} of pp collision
  data with sqrt[s]=13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC is presented.
  The search targets LLPs with masses between 5 and 55 GeV that decay hadronically
  in the ATLAS inner detector. Benchmark models with LLP pair production from exotic
  decays of the Higgs boson and models featuring long-lived axionlike particles (ALPs)
  are considered. No significant excess above the expected background is observed.
