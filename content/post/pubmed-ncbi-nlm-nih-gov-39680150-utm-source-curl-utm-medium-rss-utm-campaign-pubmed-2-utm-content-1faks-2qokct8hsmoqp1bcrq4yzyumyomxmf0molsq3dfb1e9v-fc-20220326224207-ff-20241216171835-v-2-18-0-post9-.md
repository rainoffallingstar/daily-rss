description: Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease
  affecting the peripheral and central nervous system and is caused by bi-allelic
  variants in the GAN gene, leading to loss of functional gigaxonin protein. A treatment
  does not exist, but a first clinical trial using a gene therapy approach has recently
  been completed. Here, we conducted the first systematic study of GAN patients treated
  by German-speaking child neurologists. We collected clinical, genetic, ...
