description: The thrombopoietin (TPO):cMPL signaling axis is a critical regulator
  of early hematopoiesis. However, the utility of cMPL as a standalone marker for
  identifying long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) within the
  adult human CD34+ cell hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) population
  has not been validated. In this study, we established high cMPL surface expression
  as a defining feature of human LT-HSCs. Targeting the cMPL receptor facilitated
