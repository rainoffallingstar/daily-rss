description: Per- and polysulfides are sulfane sulfur species produced inside living
  cells, in organisms as diverse as bacteria, plants and humans, but their biological
  roles remain to be fully understood. Unfortunately, due to their reactivity, per-
  and polysulfides are easily altered, interconverted or lost during the processing
  and analysis of biological material. Thus, all current analytical methods make use
  of alkylating agents, to quench reactivity of hydropersulfides and hydropolysulfides
  and also ...
