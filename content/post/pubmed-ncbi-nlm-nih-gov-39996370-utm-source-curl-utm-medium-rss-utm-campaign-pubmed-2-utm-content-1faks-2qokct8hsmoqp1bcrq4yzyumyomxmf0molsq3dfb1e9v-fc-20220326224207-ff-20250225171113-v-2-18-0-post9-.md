description: The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum affects the lives of millions
  of people worldwide every year. The detection of replicating parasites within human
  red blood cells is of paramount importance, requiring appropriate diagnostic tools.
  Herein, we design and apply a silicon rhodamine-fused glibenclamide (SiR-glib).
  We first test this far-red fluorescent, fluorogenic and endoplasmic reticulum-targeting
  sulfonylurea in mammalian cells and pancreatic tissues, before characterizing its
