description: Anhedonia, i.e., the loss of pleasure or lack of reactivity to reward,
  is a core symptom of major psychiatric conditions. Altered reward processing in
  the striatum has been observed across mood and psychotic disorders, but whether
  anhedonia transdiagnostically contributes to these deficits remains unclear. We
  investigated associations between self-reported anhedonia and neural activation
  during reward anticipation and consumption across patients with schizophrenia (SZ),
  bipolar disorder ...
