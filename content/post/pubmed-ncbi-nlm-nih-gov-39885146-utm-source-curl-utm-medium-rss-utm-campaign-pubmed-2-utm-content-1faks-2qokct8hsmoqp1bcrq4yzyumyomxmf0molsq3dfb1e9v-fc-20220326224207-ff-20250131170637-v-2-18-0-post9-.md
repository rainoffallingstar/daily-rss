description: Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) shape brain function through many
  non-canonical regulatory mechanisms beyond myelination. Here we show that OPCs form
  contacts with their processes on neuronal somata in a neuronal activity-dependent
  manner. These contacts facilitate exocytosis of neuronal lysosomes. A reduction
  in the number or branching of OPCs reduces these contacts, which is associated with
  lysosome accumulation and altered metabolism in neurons and more senescent neurons
  with age. ...
