description: Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are an invaluable tool
  to study molecular mechanisms on a human background. Culturing stem cells at an
  oxygen level different from their microenvironmental niche impacts their viability.
  To understand this mechanistically, dermal skin fibroblasts of 52 probands were
  reprogrammed into hiPSCs, followed by either hyperoxic (20 % O(2)) or physioxic
  (5 % O(2)) culture and proteomic profiling. Analysis of chromosomal stability by
  Giemsa-banding ...
