description: 'CONCLUSIONS: A novel image-guided gantry-less PT facility showed reliable
  results in terms of patient positioning for H&N cases during clinical trials. This
  fact confirmed the suitability of using gantry-less PT for H&N treatment. A small,
  systematic shift in the vertical direction was detected in the follow-up 3D/3D registration.
  The effect of this shift will be investigated in further studies with pre/post treatment
  2D/3D registration. The next phase of the clinical trial of this facility ...'
