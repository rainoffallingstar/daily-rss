  decline of tissue and organ functions, escalating vulnerability to age-related diseases.
  Stem cell therapies, standing at the frontier of regenerative medicine, hold the
  potential to mitigate the challenges induced by ageing. By harnessing the unique
  regenerative capabilities of stem cells, these therapies aim to renew and heal ageing
  or damaged cells and tissues, thereby bolstering their function. In this chapter,
