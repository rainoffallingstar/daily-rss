description: Rhodamines have been continuously optimized in brightness, biocompatibility,
  and color to fulfill the demands of modern bioimaging. However, the problem of phototoxicity
  caused by the excited fluorophore under long-term illumination has been largely
  neglected, hampering their use in time-lapse imaging. Here we introduce cyclooctatetraene
  (COT) conjugated rhodamines that span the visible spectrum and exhibit significantly
  reduced phototoxicity. We identified a general strategy for the ...
