description: Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a cancer predisposition syndrome caused by pathogenic
  TP53 germline variants and associated with a high lifelong cancer risk. We analysed
  the German LFS registry that contains data on 304 individuals. Cancer phenotypes
  were correlated with variants grouped according to their ability to transactivate
  target genes in a yeast assay using a traditional (non-functional, partially-functional)
  and a novel (clusters A, B, C) classification of variants into different ...
