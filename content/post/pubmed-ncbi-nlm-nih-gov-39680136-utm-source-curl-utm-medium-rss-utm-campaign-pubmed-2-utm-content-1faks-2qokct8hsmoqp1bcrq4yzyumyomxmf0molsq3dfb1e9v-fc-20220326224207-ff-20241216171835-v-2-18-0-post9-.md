description: Loss-of-function variants in ATP6V0A2, encoding the trans Golgi V-ATPase
  subunit V0a2, cause wrinkly skin syndrome (WSS), a connective tissue disorder with
  glycosylation defects and aberrant cortical neuron migration. We used knock-out
  (Atp6v0a2^(-/-)) and knock-in (Atp6v0a2^(RQ/RQ)) mice harboring the R755Q missense
  mutation selectively abolishing V0a2-mediated proton transport to investigate the
  WSS pathomechanism. Homozygous mutants from both strains displayed a reduction of
  growth, ...
