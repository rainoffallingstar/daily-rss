description: Metal halide perovskites hold promise for nonepitaxial laser diodes,
  yet, continuous-wave (CW) optically pumped (photonic) lasing in CsPbBr(3) remains
  elusive despite its superior thermal- and photo-stability among the perovskite family.
  This work reports on CsPbBr(3) vertical cavity surface emitting lasers with low
  lasing thresholds (1.3 µJ cm^(-) ²) at nanosecond pumping and remarkable lasing
  stability. Furthermore, the electrically switchable gain is achieved in CsPbBr(3)
