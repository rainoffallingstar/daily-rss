description: Sequence-based genetic testing identifies causative variants in ~ 50%
  of individuals with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs). Aberrant
  changes in DNA methylation are implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders
  but remain unstudied in DEEs. We interrogate the diagnostic utility of genome-wide
  DNA methylation array analysis on peripheral blood samples from 582 individuals
  with genetically unsolved DEEs. We identify rare differentially methylated regions
