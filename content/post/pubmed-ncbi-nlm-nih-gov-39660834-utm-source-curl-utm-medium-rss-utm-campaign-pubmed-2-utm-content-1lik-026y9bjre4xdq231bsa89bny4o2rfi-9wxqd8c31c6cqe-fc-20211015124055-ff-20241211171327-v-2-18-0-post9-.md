  breast cancer, treatment with imlunestrant led to significantly longer progression-free
  survival than standard therapy among those with ESR1 mutations but not in the overall
  population. Imlunestrant-abemaciclib significantly improved progression-free survival
  as compared with imlunestrant, regardless of ESR1-mutation status. (Funded by Eli
