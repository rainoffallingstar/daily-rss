description: The development of potent novel androgen receptor inhibitors (ARi) such
  as apalutamide have improved the life expectancy in men with castration-resistant
  prostate cancer (CRPCa). However, some serious toxicity can occur limiting the choice
  of treatment in CRPCa. In our case, the patient experienced severe toxicity after
  initiation of apalutamide. Diagnostic PSMA-PET/CT confirmed the recurrence and tailored
  the treatment with ^(177)Lu-PSMA-617 (RLT), a beta emitter radionuclide. RLT resulted
