description: T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) and thymoma are two rare primary tumors
  of the thymus deriving either from T-cell precursors or from thymic epithelial cells,
  respectively. Some thymoma subtypes (AB, B1, and B2) display numerous reactive terminal
  deoxynucleotidyl transferase-positive (TdT^(+)) T-cell precursors masking epithelial
  tumor cells. Therefore, the differential diagnosis between T-LBL and TdT^(+) T-lymphocyte-rich
  thymoma could be challenging, especially in the case of needle biopsy. ...
