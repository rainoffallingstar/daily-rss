description: In patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), intratumoural
  and intertumoural heterogeneity increases chemoresistance and mortality rates. However,
  such morphological and phenotypic diversities are not typically captured by organoid
  models of PDAC. Here we show that branched organoids embedded in collagen gels can
  recapitulate the phenotypic landscape seen in murine and human PDAC, that the pronounced
  molecular and morphological intratumoural and intertumoural heterogeneity ...
