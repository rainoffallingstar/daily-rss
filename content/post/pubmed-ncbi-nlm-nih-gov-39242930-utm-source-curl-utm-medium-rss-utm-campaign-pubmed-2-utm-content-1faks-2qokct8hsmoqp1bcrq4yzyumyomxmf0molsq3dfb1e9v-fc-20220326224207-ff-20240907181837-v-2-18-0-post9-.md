description: Rewards paid out for successful retrieval motivate the formation of long-term
  memory. However, it has been argued that the Motivated Learning Task does not measure
  reward effects on memory strength but decision-making during retrieval. We report
  three large-scale online experiments in healthy participants (N = 200, N = 205,
  N = 187) that inform this debate. In experiment 1, we found that explicit stimulus-reward
  associations formed during encoding influence response strategies at retrieval.
