description: Delays and risks associated with neurosurgical biopsies preclude timely
  diagnosis and treatment of central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma and other CNS neoplasms.
  We prospectively integrated targeted rapid genotyping of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
  into the evaluation of 70 patients with CNS lesions of unknown etiology. Participants
  underwent genotyping of CSF-derived DNA using a qPCR-based approach for parallel
  detection of single-nucleotide variants in the MYD88, TERT promoter, IDH1, IDH2,
