description: The purpose of this study was to determine if dual-energy CT (DECT) vital
  iodine tumor burden (ViTB), a direct assessment of tumor vascularity, allows reliable
  response assessment in patients with GIST compared to established CT criteria such
  as RECIST1.1 and modified Choi (mChoi). From 03/2014 to 12/2019, 138 patients (64
  years [32-94 years]) with biopsy proven GIST were entered in this prospective, multi-center
  trial. All patients were treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) ...
