description: Tetracoordinate silicon species are typically tetrahedral, weak Lewis
  acids, and often sensitive to moisture. In this study, we present a tetra-amido
  macrocyclic ligand (TAML)-substituted Si(IV), isolated as its bis(pyridine) adduct.
  Due to structural constraint toward anti van't-Hof/Le Bel geometry, this compound
  exhibits Lewis superacidity and effectively catalyzes the hydroboration of pyridine.
  Kinetic and computational analyses of the catalytic cycle reveal that TAML-Si(IV)
  acts as a ...
