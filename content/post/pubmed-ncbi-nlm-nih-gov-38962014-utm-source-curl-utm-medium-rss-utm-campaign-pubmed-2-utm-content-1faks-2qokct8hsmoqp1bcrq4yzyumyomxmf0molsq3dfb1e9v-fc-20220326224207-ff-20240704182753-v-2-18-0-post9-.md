description: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has effectively complemented
  the treatment of advanced relapsed and refractory hematological cancers. The remarkable
  achievements of CD19- and BCMA-CAR T therapies have raised high expectations within
  the fields of hematology and oncology. These groundbreaking successes are propelling
  a collective aspiration to extend the reach of CAR therapies beyond B-lineage malignancies.
  Advanced CAR technologies have created a momentum to surmount ...
