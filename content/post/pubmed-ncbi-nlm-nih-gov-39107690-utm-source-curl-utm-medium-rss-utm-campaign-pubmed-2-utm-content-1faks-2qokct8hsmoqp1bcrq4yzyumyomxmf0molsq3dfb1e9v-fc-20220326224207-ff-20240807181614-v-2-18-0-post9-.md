description: The recent advances in high-throughput single-cell sequencing have created
  an urgent demand for computational models which can address the high complexity
  of single-cell multiomics data. Meticulous single-cell multiomics integration models
  are required to avoid biases towards a specific modality and overcome sparsity.
  Batch effects obfuscating biological signals must also be taken into account. Here,
  we introduce a new single-cell multiomics integration model, Single-cell Multiomics
