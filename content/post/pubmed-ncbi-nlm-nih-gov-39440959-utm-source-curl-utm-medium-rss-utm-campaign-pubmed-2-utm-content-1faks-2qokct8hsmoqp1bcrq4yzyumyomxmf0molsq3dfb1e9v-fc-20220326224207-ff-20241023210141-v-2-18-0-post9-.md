description: Skin aging is driven by a complex set of cellular pathways. Among these,
  epigenetic mechanisms have garnered particular attention, because of their sensitivity
  to environmental and lifestyle factors. DNA methylation represents the longest known
  and best understood epigenetic mechanism. We explain how DNA methylation might function
  as an interface between the environment and the genome of human skin. Exposures
