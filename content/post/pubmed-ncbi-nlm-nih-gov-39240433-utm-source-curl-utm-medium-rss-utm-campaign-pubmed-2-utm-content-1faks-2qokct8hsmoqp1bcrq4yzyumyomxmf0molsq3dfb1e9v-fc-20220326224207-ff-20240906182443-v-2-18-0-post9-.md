description: Under regulations such as REACH, testing of novel and established compounds
  for their (neuro)toxic potential is a legal requirement in many countries. These
  are largely based on animal-, cost-, and time-intensive in vivo models, not in line
  with the 3 Rs' principle of animal experimentation. Thus, the development of alternative
  test methods has also received increasing attention in neurotoxicology. Such methods
  focus either on physiological alterations in brain development and neuronal ...
