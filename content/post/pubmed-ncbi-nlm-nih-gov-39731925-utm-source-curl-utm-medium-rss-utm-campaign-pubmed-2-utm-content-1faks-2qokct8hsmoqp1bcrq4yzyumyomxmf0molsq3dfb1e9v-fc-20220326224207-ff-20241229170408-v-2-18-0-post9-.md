  identified. However, experimental data are needed to understand their relative contributions.
  We highlight the sublethal effects of pesticides at field-relevant concentrations,
  often overlooked in standard environmental risk assessments (ERA), as significant
  contributors to these declines. Behavior, as an easily monitored high-level phenotype,
  reflects alterations at various phenotypic levels. We propose ...
