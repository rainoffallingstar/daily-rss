description: The transcription factor GATA-3 and the transcriptional program it regulates
  have emerged as oncogenic drivers across diverse T-cell lymphomas (TCL), many of
  which are resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic agents and characterized by
  recurrent losses of key tumor suppressor genes, including TP53 and PTEN, both of
  which are clients of the nuclear export protein XPO1. Here we demonstrated that
  XPO1 is highly expressed by malignant T cells expressing GATA-3 and by lymphoma-associated...
