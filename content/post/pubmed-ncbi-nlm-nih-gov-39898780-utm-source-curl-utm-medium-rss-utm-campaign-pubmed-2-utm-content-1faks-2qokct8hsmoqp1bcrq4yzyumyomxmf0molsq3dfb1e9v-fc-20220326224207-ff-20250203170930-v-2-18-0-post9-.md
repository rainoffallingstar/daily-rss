description: Background Waist circumference (WC) and its allometric counterpart, "a
  body shape index" (ABSI), are risk factors for colorectal cancer (CRC); however,
  it is uncertain whether associations with these body measurements are limited to
  specific molecular subtypes of the disease. Methods Data from 2,772 CRC cases and
  3,521 controls were pooled from four cohort studies within the Genetics and Epidemiology
  of Colorectal Cancer Consortium. Four molecular markers (BRAF mutation, KRAS mutation,
