description: The interpretation of multi-omics datasets obtained from high-throughput
  approaches is important to understand disease-related physiological changes and
  to predict biomarkers in body fluids. We present a new metabolite-centred genome-scale
  metabolic modelling algorithm, the Gene Expression-based Metabolite Centrality Analysis
  Tool (GEMCAT). GEMCAT enables integration of transcriptomics or proteomics data
  to predict changes in metabolite concentrations, which can be verified by ...
