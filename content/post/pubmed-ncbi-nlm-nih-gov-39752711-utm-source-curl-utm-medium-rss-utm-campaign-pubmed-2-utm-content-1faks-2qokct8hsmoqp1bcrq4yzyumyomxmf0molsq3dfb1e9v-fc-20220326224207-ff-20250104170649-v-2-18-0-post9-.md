description: We realize a Laughlin state of two rapidly rotating fermionic atoms in
  an optical tweezer. By utilizing a single atom and spin resolved imaging technique,
  we sample the Laughlin wave function thereby revealing its distinctive features,
  including a vortex distribution in the relative motion, correlations in the particles'
  relative angle, and suppression of the interparticle interactions. Our Letter lays
  the foundation for atom-by-atom assembly of fractional quantum Hall states in rotating
