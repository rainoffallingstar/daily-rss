description: Telomere maintenance in neuroblastoma is linked to poor outcome and caused
  by either telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) activation or through alternative
  lengthening of telomeres (ALT). In contrast to TERT activation, commonly caused
  by genomic rearrangements or MYCN amplification, ALT is less well understood. Alterations
  at the ATRX locus are key drivers of ALT but only present in ∼50% of ALT tumors.
  To identify potential new pathways to telomere maintenance, we investigate ...
