description: The formation of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) filaments has been implicated
  in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Although the disulfide bond formed between
  Cys57 and Cys146 in the active state has been well studied, the role of the reduced
  cysteine residues, Cys6 and Cys111, in SOD1 filament formation remains unclear.
  In this study, we investigated the role of reduced cysteine residues by determining
  and comparing cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of wild-type (WT) and
