description: A practical approach for rapid and efficient access to spirocyclic isobenzofurans
  is described. The reaction proceeds through the cycloaddition of 1,6-ynenone derivatives
  and 4-nitro-1,3-diarylbutan-1-ones, promoted by Cs(2)CO(3) in the presence of l-proline
  as a catalyst. The advantages of this reaction include the formation of two C-C
  bonds and one C-O bond as well as mild reaction conditions. Extended spirocyclic
  isobenzofurans are obtained with good efficiency and diastereoselectivity ...
