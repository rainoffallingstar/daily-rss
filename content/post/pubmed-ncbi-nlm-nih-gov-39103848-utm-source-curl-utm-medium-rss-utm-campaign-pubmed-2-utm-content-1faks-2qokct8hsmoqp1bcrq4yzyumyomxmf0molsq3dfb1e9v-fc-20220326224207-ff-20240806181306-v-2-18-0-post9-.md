description: PARP inhibitor (PARPi) therapy has transformed outcomes for patients
  with homologous recombination DNA repair (HRR) deficient ovarian cancers, for example
  those with BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene defects. Unfortunately, PARPi resistance is common.
  Multiple resistance mechanisms have been described, including secondary mutations
  that restore the HR gene reading frame. BRCA1 splice isoforms △11 and △11q can contribute
  to PARPi resistance by splicing out the mutation-containing exon, producing ...
