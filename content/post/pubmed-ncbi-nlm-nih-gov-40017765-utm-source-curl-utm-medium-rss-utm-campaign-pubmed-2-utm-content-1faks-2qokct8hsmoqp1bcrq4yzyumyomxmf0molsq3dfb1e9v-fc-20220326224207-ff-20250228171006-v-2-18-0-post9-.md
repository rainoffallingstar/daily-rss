description: Lactate is a key metabolic driver in oncology and immunology. Even in
  the presence of physiological oxygen levels, most cancer cells upregulate anaerobic
  glycolysis, resulting in abnormal lactate production and accumulation in the tumor
  microenvironment. The development of more effective, sensitive, and safe probes
  for detecting extracellular lactate holds the potential to significantly impact
  cancer metabolic profiling and staging significantly. Macrocyclic-based PARACEST
  agents have ...
