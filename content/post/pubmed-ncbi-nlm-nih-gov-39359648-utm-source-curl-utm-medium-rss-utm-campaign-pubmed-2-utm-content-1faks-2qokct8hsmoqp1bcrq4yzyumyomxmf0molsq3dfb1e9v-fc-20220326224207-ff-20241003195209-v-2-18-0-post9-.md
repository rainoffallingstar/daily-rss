description: Large language models have been shown to excel in many different tasks
  across disciplines and research sites. They provide novel opportunities to enhance
  educational research and instruction in different ways such as assessment. However,
  these methods have also been shown to have fundamental limitations. These relate,
  among others, to hallucinating knowledge, explainability of model decisions, and
