description: T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) and T-cell acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia (T-ALL) have common and distinguishing clinical and molecular features.
  Molecular prognostic factors are needed for T-LBL. We assessed the prevalence and
  prognostic impact of the T-cell receptor ß (TRB)::NOTCH1 fusion in 192 T-LBL and
  167 pediatric T-ALL patients, using novel multiplex PCR and genomic capture high-throughput
  sequencing techniques. The fusion was detected in twelve T-LBL patients (6.3 %)
  but in none ...
