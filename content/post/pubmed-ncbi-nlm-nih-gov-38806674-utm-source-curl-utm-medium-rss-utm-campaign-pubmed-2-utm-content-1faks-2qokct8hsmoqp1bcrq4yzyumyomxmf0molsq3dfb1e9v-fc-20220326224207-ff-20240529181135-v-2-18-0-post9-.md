description: Interference with microtubule dynamics in mitosis activates the spindle
  assembly checkpoint (SAC) to prevent chromosome segregation errors. The SAC induces
  mitotic arrest by inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) via the mitotic
  checkpoint complex (MCC). The MCC component MAD2 neutralizes the critical APC cofactor,
  CDC20, preventing exit from mitosis. Extended mitotic arrest can promote mitochondrial
  apoptosis and caspase activation. However, the impact of mitotic cell death on ...
