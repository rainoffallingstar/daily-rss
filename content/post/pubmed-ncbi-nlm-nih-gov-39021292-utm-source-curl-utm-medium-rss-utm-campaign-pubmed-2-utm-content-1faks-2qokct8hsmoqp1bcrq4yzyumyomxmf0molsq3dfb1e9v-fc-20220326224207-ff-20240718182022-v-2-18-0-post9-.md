description: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection has long been associated with the
  development of multiple sclerosis (MS). MS patients have elevated titers of EBV-specific
  antibodies in serum and show signs of CNS damage only after EBV infection. Regarding
  CD8+ T-cells, an elevated but ineffective response to EBV was suggested in MS patients,
  who present with a broader MHC-I-restricted EBV-specific T-cell receptor beta chain
  (TRB) repertoire compared to controls. It is not known whether this altered ...
