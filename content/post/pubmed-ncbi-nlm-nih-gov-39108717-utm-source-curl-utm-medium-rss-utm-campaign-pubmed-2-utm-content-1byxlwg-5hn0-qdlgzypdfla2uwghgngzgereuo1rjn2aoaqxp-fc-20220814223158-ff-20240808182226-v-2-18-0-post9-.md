description: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is highly heterogeneous, necessitating personalized
  prognosis prediction and treatment strategies. Many of the current patient classifications
  are based on molecular features. Here, we classified the primary AML patients by
  predicted death risk curves and investigated the survival-directly-related molecular
  features. We developed a deep learning model to predict 5-year continuous-time survival
  probabilities for each patient and converted them to death risk ...
