description: 'CONCLUSION: We could demonstrate that anonymization and synthetization
  methods protect privacy while retaining data utility for heart failure risk assessment.
  Both approaches and a combination thereof introduce only minimal deviations from
  the original data set over all features. While data synthesis techniques produce
  any number of new records, data anonymization techniques offer more formal privacy
  guarantees. Consequently, data synthesis on anonymized data further enhances privacy
