description: Purpose To assess the effectiveness and pain intensity associated with
  magnetic ureteric stent removal using a retriever, without the aid of ultrasound
  guidance. Methods We prospectively enrolled 100 patients who underwent retrograde
  rigid/flexible ureterorenoscopy with or without laser lithotripsy for ureteronephrolithiasis
  treatment from September 2021 to June 2023. These patients were assigned in two
  groups. Group 1 underwent the traditional ureteric stent insertion, while Group
  2 ...
