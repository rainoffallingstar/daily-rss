description: The dual reactivity of boron compounds as Lewis acids and electron donors
  has spurred the development of a metallomimetic chemistry of boron compounds as
  a topical research theme. In this work we elaborate on the reaction of specially-designed
  diborane(4) compounds with quinones, as a prime example showing their dual (metallomimetic)
  chemistry as a Lewis acid and electron donor. The quinone is first coordinated to
  the diborane and then reduced by intramolecular electron transfer from the ...
