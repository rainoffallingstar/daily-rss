description: Ewing sarcoma (EwS) cell line culture largely relies on standard techniques,
  which do not recapitulate physiological conditions. Here, we report on a feasible
  and cost-efficient EwS cell culture technique with increased physiological relevance
  employing an advanced medium composition, reduced fetal calf serum, and spheroidal
  growth. Improved reflection of the transcriptional activity related to proliferation,
  hypoxia, and differentiation in EwS patient tumors was detected in EwS cells grown
