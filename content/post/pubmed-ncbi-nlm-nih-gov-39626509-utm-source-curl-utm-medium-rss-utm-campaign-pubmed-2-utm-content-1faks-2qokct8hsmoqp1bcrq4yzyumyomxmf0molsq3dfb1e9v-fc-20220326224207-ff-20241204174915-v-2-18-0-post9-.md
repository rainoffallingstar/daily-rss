  improve cardiorespiratory fitness (V˙O(2) max) but may ameliorate insulin sensitivity
  only in insulin-resistant humans. It is yet unclear whether these benefits persist
  after detraining and to which extent duration and effectiveness of metabolic improvements
  differ between individuals without and with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes (T2D).
  Understanding these differences is relevant for developing targeted exercise ...'
