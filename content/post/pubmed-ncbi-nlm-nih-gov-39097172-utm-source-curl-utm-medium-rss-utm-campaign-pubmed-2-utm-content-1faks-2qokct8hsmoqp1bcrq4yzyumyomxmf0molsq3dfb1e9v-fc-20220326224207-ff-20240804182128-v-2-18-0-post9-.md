description: We provide an overview of the expanding literature on the role of cytokines
  and immune mediators in pathophysiology of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
  Although many immunological mediators have been linked to AMD pathophysiology, the
  broader mechanistic picture remains unclear with substantial variations in the levels
  of evidence supporting these mediators. Therefore, we reviewed the literature considering
  the varying levels of supporting evidence. A Medical Subject Headings ...
