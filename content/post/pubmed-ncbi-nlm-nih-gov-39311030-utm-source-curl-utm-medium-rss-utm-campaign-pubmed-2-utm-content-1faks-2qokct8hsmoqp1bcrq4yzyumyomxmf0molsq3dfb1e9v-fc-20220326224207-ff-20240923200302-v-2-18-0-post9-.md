description: Imaging ultrafast atomic and molecular hydrogen motion with femtosecond
  time resolution is a challenge for ultrafast spectroscopy due to the low mass and
  small scattering cross section of the moving neutral hydrogen atoms and molecules.
  Here, we propose time- and momentum-resolved photoelectron diffraction (TMR-PED)
  as a way to overcome limitations of existing methodologies and illustrate its performance
  using a prototype molecular dissociation process involving the sequential ejection
