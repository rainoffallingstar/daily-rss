description: Ticagrelor, a reversible platelet P2Y(12) receptor antagonist, exerts
  various pleiotropic actions, some of which are at least partially mediated through
  adenosine. We studied the ticagrelor and adenosine effect on the angiogenic properties
  of progenitor CD34^(+)-derived endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs). Angiogenesis
  studies were performed in vitro using capillary-like tube formation and spheroid-based
  angiogenesis assays. The effects of adenosine receptor antagonists, including ...
