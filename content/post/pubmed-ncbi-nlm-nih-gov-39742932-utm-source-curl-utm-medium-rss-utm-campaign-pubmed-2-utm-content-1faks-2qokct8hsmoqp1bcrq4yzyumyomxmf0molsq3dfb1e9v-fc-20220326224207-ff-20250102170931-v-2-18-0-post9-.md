description: Impaired cardiomyocyte Ca^(2+) handling is a central hallmark of heart
  failure (HF), which causes contractile dysfunction and arrhythmias. However, the
  underlying molecular mechanisms and the precise contribution of defects in Ca^(2+)-cycling
  regulation in the development of HF are still not completely resolved. Here, we
  used transgenic mice that express a human mutation in the cardiomyocyte Ca^(2+)-regulator
  phospholamban (PLN^(R9C)-tg) causing severe HF due to a reduction in Ca^(2+) ...
