description: We observe an inverse turbulent-wave cascade, from small to large length
  scales, in a driven homogeneous 2D Bose gas. Starting with an equilibrium condensate,
  we drive the gas isotropically on a length scale much smaller than its size, and
  observe a nonthermal population of modes with wavelengths larger than the drive
  one. At long drive times, the gas exhibits a steady nonthermal momentum distribution.
  At length scales increasing from the drive one to the system size, this distribution
