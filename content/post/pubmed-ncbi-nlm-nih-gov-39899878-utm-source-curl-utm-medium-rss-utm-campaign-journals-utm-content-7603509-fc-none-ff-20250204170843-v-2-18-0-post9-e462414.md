description: The contribution of IL-10 secreted by tumoral B cells to the progression
  and shaping of the microenvironment in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with
  activated B-cell (ABC) phenotype is not yet completely understood. To shed light
  on this issue, we generated an immunocompetent mouse model of ABC-DLBCL with conditional
  knock-out of IL-10 specifically in malignant B cells. Paradoxically, these mice
  had significantly worse overall survival when left untreated, but experienced ...
