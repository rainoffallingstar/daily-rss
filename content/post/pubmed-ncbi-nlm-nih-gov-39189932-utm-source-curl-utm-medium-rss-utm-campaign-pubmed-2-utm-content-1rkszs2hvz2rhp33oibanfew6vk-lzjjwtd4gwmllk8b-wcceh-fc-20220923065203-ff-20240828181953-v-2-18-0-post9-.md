description: Little is known about the central nervous system (CNS) risk in high-grade
  B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (HGBL, NOS). Hence, we sought to describe
  the rates of baseline CNS involvement, risk of CNS recurrence after primary therapy,
  and management strategies in HGBL, NOS. In this multicenter retrospective study,
  we included 160 adults with newly diagnosed HGBL, NOS treated between 2016 and 2021
  at 20 US institutions. Eleven patients (7%) had baseline CNS involvement at ...
