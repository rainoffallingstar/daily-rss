description: Currently, the role of DNA methylation in the IgM-monoclonal gammopathy
  disease spectrum remains poorly understood. In the present study, a multi-omics
  prospective analysis was conducted integrating DNA methylation, RNA-seq and WES
  data in 34 subjects [23 WM, 6 IgM-MGUS, 5 normal controls]. Analysis was focused
  on defining differences between IgM-gammopathies (WM/IgM-MGUS) compared to controls,
  and specifically between WM and IgM-MGUS. Between groups, genome-wide DNA methylation
