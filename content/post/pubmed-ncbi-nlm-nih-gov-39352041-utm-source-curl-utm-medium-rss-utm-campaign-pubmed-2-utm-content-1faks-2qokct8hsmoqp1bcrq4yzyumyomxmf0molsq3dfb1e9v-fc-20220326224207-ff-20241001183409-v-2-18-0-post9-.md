description: The emergence of highly wavelength resolved reactivity information for
  complex photochemical reaction processes allows the establishment of multi-color
  reaction modes. One particularly powerful mode is the synergistic two-color reaction,
  where two colors of light have to be present in the same volume element to either
  enable or enhance photochemical reactivity that leads to a specific photoproduct.
  Herein, we introduce a two-color synergistic photochemical reaction system based
  on a ...
