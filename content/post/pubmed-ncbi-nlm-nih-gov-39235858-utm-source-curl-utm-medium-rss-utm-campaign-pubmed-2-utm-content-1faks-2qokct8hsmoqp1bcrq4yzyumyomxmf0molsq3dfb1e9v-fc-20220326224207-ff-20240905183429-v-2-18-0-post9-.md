description: Substance use, including cigarettes and cannabis, is associated with
  poorer sustained attention in late adolescence and early adulthood. Previous studies
  were predominantly cross-sectional or under-powered and could not indicate if impairment
  in sustained attention was a predictor of substance use or a marker of the inclination
  to engage in such behavior. This study explored the relationship between sustained
