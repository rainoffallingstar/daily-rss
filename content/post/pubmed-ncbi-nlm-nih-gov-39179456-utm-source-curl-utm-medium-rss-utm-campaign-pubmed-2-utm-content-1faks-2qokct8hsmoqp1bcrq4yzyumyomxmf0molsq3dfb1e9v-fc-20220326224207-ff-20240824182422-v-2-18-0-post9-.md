description: Results from a wide range of searches targeting different experimental
  signatures with and without missing transverse momentum (E(T)^(miss)) are used to
  constrain a Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) with an additional pseudo-scalar mediating
  the interaction between ordinary and dark matter (2HDM+a). The analyses use up to
  139 fb^(-1) of proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy s=13 TeV
  recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider during 2015-2018.
