description: Baby schema features are a specific set of physical features-including
  chubby cheeks, large, low-set eyes, and a large, round head-that have evolutionary
  adaptive value in their ability to trigger nurturant care. In this study among nulliparous
  women (N = 81; M age = 23.60, SD = 0.44), we examined how sensitivity to these baby
  schema features differs based on individual variations in nurturant care motivation
  and oxytocin system gene methylation. We integrated subjective ratings with measures
