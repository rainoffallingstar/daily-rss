description: CD30-directed CART cell therapy (CART30) has limited efficacy in relapsed
  or refractory patients with CD30+ lymphoma, with a low proportion of durable responses.
  We have developed an academic CART30 cell product (HSP-CAR30) by combining strategies
  to improve performance. HSP-CAR30 targets a proximal epitope within the non-soluble
  part of CD30, and the manufacturing process includes a modulation of ex vivo T cell
  activation, as well as the addition of interleukin-21 to IL-7 and IL-15 to ...
