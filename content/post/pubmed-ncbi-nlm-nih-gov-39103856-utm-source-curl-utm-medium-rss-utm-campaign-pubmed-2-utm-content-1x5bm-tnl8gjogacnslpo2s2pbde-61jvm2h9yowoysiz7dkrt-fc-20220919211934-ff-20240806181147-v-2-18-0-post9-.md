description: Cell type identification is an indispensable analytical step in single-cell
  data analyses. To address the high noise stemming from gene expression data, existing
  computational methods often overlook the biologically meaningful relationships between
  genes, opting to reduce all genes to a unified data space. We assume that such relationships
  can aid in characterizing cell type features and improving cell type recognition
  accuracy. To this end, we introduce scPriorGraph, a dual-channel graph ...
