description: The HOVON 104 studied bortezomib-dexamethasone induction therapy and
  autologous stem cell transplantation in 50 patients, of whom 35 received an autologous
  stem cell transplantation (ASCT). We demonstrate a 5-year overall survival (OS)
  of 73% and progression-free survival (PFS) of 52% for all 50 patients with a median
  follow-up of 61.3 months. For the 35 transplanted patients, calculated from the
  date of ASCT, the 5-year OS and PFS were 91% and 68%, respectively. After ASCT,
