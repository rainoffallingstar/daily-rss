description: Cell metabolism reprogramming to sustain energy production, while reducing
  oxygen and energy consuming processes is crucially important for the adaptation
  to hypoxia/ischemia. Adaptive metabolic rewiring is controlled by hypoxia-inducible
  factors (HIFs). Accumulating experimental evidence indicates that timely activation
  of HIF in brain-resident cells improves the outcome from acute ischemic stroke.
  However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still incompletely understood.
