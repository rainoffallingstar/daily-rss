description: Loss of endothelial barrier function contributes to the pathophysiology
  of many inflammatory diseases. Coagulation factor XI (FXI) plays a regulatory role
  in inflammation. While activation of FXI increases vascular permeability in vivo,
  the mechanism by which FXI or its activated form FXIa disrupts endothelial barrier
  function is unknown. We investigated the role of FXIa in human umbilical vein endothelial
