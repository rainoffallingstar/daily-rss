description: A hypergraph is a generalization of a graph that depicts higher-order
  relations. Predicting higher-order relations, i.e. hyperedges, is a fundamental
  problem in hypergraph studies, and has immense applications in multiple domains.
  Recent development of graph neural network (GNN) advanced the prediction of pair-wise
  relations in graphs. However, existing methods can hardly be extended to hypergraphs
  due to the lack of higher-order dependency in their graph embedding. In this paper,
