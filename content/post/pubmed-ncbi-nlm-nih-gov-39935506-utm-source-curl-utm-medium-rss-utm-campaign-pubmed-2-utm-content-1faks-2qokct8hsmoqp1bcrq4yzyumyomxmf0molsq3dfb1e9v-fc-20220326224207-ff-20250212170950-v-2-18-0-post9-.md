description: Atomistic simulations are routinely employed in academia and industry
  to study the behavior of molecules, materials, and their interfaces. Central to
  these simulations are force fields (FFs), whose development is challenged by intricate
  interatomic interactions at different spatio-temporal scales and the vast expanse
  of chemical space. Machine learning (ML) FFs, trained on quantum-mechanical energies
  and forces, have shown the capacity to achieve sub-kcal (mol^(-1) Å^(-1)) accuracy
