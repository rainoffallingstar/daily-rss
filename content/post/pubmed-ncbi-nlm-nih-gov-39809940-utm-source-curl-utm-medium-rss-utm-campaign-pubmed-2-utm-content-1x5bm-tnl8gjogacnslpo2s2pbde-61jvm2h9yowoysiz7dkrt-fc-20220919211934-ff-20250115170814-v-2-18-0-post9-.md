description: The NLRP3 inflammasome, regulated by TLR4, plays a pivotal role in periodontitis
  by mediating inflammatory cytokine release and bone loss induced by Porphyromonas
  gingivalis. Periodontal disease creates a hypoxic environment, favoring anaerobic
  bacteria survival and exacerbating inflammation. The NLRP3 inflammasome triggers
  pyroptosis, a programmed cell death that amplifies inflammation and tissue damage.
