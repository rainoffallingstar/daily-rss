description: Numerous cellular and molecular processes during embryonic development
  prompt the fundamental question of how their tempos are coordinated and whether
  a common global modulator exists. While the segmentation clock tempo scales with
  the kinetics of gene expression and degradation processes of the core clock gene
  Hes7 across mammals, the coordination of these processes remains unclear. This study
  examines whether metabolic activities serve as a global modulator for the segmentation
  clock, ...
