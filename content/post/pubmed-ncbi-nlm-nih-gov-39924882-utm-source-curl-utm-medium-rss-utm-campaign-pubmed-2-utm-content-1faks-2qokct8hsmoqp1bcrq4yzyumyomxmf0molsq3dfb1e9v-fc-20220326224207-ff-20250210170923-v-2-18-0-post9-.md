description: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent a central cell population
  of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Recently, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq)
  analyses of primary tumors of different cancer entities yielded different classifications
  of CAF subsets underscoring the heterogeneity of CAFs within the TME. Here, we analyzed
  the transcriptional signatures of approximately 8400 CAFs and normal fibroblasts
  by scRNA-seq and compared genetic profiles of CAFs from murine melanoma ...
