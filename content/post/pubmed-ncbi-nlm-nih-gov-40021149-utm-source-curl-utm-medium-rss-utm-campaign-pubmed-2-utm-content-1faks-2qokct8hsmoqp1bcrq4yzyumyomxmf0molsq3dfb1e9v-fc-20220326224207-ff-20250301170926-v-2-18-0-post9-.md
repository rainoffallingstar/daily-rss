description: The branching fraction ratios of B[over ¯]^{0}→D^{+}τ^{-}ν[over ¯]_{τ}
  and B[over ¯]^{0}→D^{*+}τ^{-}ν[over ¯]_{τ} decays are measured with respect to their
  muonic counterparts, using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity
  of 2.0 fb^{-1} collected by the LHCb experiment in proton-proton collisions at sqrt[s]=13
  TeV. The reconstructed final states are formed by combining D^{+} mesons with τ^{-}→μ^{-}ν[over
  ¯]_{μ}ν_{τ} candidates, where the D^{+} is reconstructed via ...
