description: Sexual dimorphism arises because of divergent fitness optima between
  the sexes. Phenotypic divergence between sexes can range from mild to extreme. Fireflies,
  bioluminescent beetles, present various degrees of sexual dimorphism, with species
  showing very mild sexual dimorphism to species presenting female-specific neoteny,
  posing a unique framework to investigate the evolution of sexually dimorphic traits
  across species. In this work, we present novel assembled genomes of two firefly
