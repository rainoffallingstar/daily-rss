description: Myocarditis, characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration, can have
  multiple etiologies, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
  infection or, rarely, mRNA-based coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination.
  The underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this
  study, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing on left ventricular endomyocardial
  biopsies from patients with myocarditis unrelated to COVID-19 (Non-COVID-19), ...
