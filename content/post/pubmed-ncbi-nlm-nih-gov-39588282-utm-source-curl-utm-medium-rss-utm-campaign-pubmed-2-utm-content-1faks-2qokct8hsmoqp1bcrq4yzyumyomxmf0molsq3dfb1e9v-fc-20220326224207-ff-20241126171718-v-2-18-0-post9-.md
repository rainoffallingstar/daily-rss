description: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, adult-onset disease marked
  by a progressive degeneration of motor neurons (MNs) present in the spinal cord,
  brain stem and motor cortex. Death in most patients usually occurs within 2-4 years
  after symptoms onset. Despite promising progress in delineating underlying mechanisms,
  such as disturbed proteostasis, DNA/RNA metabolism, splicing or proper nucleocytoplasmic
  shuttling, there are no effective therapies for the vast majority of cases. A ...
