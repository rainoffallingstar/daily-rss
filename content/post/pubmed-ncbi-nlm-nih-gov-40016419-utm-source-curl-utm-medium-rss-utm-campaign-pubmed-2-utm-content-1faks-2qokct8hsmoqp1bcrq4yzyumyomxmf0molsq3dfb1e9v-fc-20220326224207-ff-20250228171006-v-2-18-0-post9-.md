description: Protein synthesis is an essential process, deregulated in multiple tumor
  types showing differential dependence on translation factors compared to untransformed
  tissue. We show that colorectal cancer (CRC) with loss-of-function mutation in the
  APC tumor suppressor depends on an oncogenic translation program regulated by the
  ability to sense phosphorylated eIF2α (p-eIF2α). Despite increased protein synthesis
  rates following APC loss, eIF2α phosphorylation, typically associated with ...
