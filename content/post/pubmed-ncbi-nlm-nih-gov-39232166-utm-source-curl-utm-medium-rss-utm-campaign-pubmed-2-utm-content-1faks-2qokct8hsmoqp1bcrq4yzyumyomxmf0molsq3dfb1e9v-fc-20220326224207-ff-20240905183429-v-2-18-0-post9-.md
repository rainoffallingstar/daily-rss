description: Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the mammalian brain and
  provide structural and metabolic support to neurons, regulate synapses and become
  reactive after injury and disease. However, a small subset of astrocytes settles
  in specialized areas of the adult brain where these astrocytes instead actively
  generate differentiated neuronal and glial progeny and are therefore referred to
  as neural stem cells^(1-3). Common parenchymal astrocytes and quiescent neural stem
  cells share ...
