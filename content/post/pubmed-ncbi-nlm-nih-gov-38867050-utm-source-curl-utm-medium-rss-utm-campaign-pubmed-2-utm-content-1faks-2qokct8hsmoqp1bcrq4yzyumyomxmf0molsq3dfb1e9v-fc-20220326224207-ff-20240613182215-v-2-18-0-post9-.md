description: Malaria-causing protozoa of the genus Plasmodium have exerted one of
  the strongest selective pressures on the human genome, and resistance alleles provide
  biomolecular footprints that outline the historical reach of these species¹. Nevertheless,
  debate persists over when and how malaria parasites emerged as human pathogens and
  spread around the globe^(1,2). To address these questions, we generated high-coverage
  ancient mitochondrial and nuclear genome-wide data from P. falciparum, P. vivax
