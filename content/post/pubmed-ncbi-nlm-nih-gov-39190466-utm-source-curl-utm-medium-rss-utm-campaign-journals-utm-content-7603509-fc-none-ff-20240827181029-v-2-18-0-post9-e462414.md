description: Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a complicated bleeding disease characterized
  by sharp platelet reduction. As a dominating element involved in ITP, megakaryocytes
  (MKs) are responsible for thrombopoiesis. However, the mechanism underlying the
  dysregulation of thrombopoiesis that occurs in ITP remains unidentified. In this
  study, we examined the role of yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) in thrombopoiesis
  during ITP. We observed a reduced YAP1 expression with cytoskeletal actin misalignment
  in ...
