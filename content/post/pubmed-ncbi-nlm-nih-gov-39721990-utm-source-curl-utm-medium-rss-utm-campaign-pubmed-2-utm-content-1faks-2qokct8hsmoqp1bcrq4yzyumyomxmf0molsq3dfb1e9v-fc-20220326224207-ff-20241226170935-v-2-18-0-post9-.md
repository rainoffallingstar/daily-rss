description: Gephyrocapsa huxleyi is a prevalent, bloom-forming phytoplankton species
  in the oceans. It exhibits a complex haplodiplontic life cycle, featuring a diploid-calcified
  phase, a haploid phase and a third 'decoupled' phase produced during viral infection.
  Decoupled cells display a haploid-like phenotype, but are diploid. Here, we investigated
  the fate of decoupled cells during culture observations and we compared the transcriptome
  profiles and the cellular ultrastructure of the three life ...
