description: Epidemiological studies have provided strong evidence that Epstein-Barr
  virus (EBV) lytic replication is linked to cancer development. Evidence of abortive
  lytic replication in some tumors and infections with recombinant viruses incapable
  of lytic replication in animal models have reinforced this view. Furthermore, multiple
  lytic proteins have been shown to induce genetic instability, a well-characterized
  precancerous state. In particular, lytic proteins dysregulated the DNA damage ...
