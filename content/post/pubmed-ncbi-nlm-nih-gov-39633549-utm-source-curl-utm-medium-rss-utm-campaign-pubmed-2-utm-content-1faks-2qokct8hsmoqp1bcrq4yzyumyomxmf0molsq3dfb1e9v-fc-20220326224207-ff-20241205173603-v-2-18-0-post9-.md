description: We investigated the effect of center-specific variables on overall survival
  (OS) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) in acute myeloid
  leukemia (AML). Eligible were adult patients reported to DRST registry receiving
  first alloHCT for AML from a related or matched (>= 9/10 HLA-match) unrelated donor
  2015-2021. Primary endpoint was OS at 12 months from alloHCT. Univariable and multivariable
  analyses after best subset selection was performed. Of 5328 patients, 83% ...
