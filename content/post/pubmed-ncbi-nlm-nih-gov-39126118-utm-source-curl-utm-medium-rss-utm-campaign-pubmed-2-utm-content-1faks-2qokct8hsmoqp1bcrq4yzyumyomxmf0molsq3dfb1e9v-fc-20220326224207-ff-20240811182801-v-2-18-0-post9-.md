description: The Hippo pathway transducers yes-associated protein (YAP) and WW-domain
  containing transcription regulator 1 (WWTR1/TAZ) are key regulators of liver tumorigenesis,
  promoting tumor formation and progression. Although the first inhibitors are in
  clinical trials, targeting the relevant upstream regulators of YAP/TAZ activity
  could prove equally beneficial. To identify regulators of YAP/TAZ activity in hepatocarcinoma
  (HCC) cells, we carried out a proximity labelling approach (BioID) coupled ...
