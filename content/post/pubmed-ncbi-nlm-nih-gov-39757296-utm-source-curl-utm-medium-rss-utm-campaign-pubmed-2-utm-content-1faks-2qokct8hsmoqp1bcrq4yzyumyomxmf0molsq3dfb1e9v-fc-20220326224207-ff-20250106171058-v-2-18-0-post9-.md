description: The γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) is a structural template for controlled
  nucleation of microtubules from α/β-tubulin heterodimers. At the cytoplasmic side
  of the yeast spindle pole body, the CM1-containing receptor protein Spc72 promotes
  γ-TuRC assembly from seven γ-tubulin small complexes (γ-TuSCs) and recruits the
  microtubule polymerase Stu2, yet their molecular interplay remains unclear. Here,
  we determine the cryo-EM structure of the Candida albicans cytoplasmic nucleation
  unit at 3.6 ...
