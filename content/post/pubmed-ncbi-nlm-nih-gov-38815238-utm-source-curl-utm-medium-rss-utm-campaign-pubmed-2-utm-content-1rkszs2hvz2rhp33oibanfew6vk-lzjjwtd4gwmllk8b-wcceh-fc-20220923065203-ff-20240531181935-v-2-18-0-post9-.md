description: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a potent carcinogen linked to hematologic
  and solid malignancies, causing significant global morbidity and mortality. Therapy
  using allogeneic EBV-specific lymphocytes shows promise in certain populations,
  but the impact of EBV genome variation on these strategies remains unexplored. To
  address this, we sequenced 217 EBV genomes, including hematologic malignancies from
  Guatemala, Peru, Malawi, and Taiwan, and analyzed them alongside 1,307 publicly
