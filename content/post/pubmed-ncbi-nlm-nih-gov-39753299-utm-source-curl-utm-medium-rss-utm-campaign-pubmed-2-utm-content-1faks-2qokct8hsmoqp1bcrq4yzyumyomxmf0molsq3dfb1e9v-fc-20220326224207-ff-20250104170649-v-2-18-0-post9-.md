description: For a proper representation of the causal structure of the world, it
  is adaptive to consider both evidence for and evidence against causality. To take
  punishment as an example, the causality of a stimulus is unlikely if there is a
  temporal gap before punishment is received, but causality is credible if the stimulus
  immediately precedes punishment. In contrast, causality can be ruled out if the
  punishment occurred first. At the behavioral level, this is reflected in the associative
