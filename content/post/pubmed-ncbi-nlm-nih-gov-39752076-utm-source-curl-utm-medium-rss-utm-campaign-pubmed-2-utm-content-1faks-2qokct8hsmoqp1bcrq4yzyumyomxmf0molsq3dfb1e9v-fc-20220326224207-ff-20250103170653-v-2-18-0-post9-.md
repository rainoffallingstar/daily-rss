description: Robot-assisted surgery represents a significant innovation in reconstructive
  microsurgery, providing enhanced precision and reduced surgeon fatigue. This study
  examines the integration of robotic assistance in a series of 85 consecutive robot-assisted
  microsurgical (RAMS) operations. It aims to evaluate changes in the integration
  of RAMS during the implementation phase in a single institution. The study utilized
