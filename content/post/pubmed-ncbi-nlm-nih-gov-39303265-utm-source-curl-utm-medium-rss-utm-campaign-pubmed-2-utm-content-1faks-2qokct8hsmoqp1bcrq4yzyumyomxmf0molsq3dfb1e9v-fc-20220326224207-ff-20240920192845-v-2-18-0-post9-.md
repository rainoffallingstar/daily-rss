description: This Letter presents results from a combination of searches for Higgs
  boson pair production using 126-140 fb^{-1} of proton-proton collision data at sqrt[s]=13
  TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector. At 95% confidence level (CL), the upper limit
  on the production rate is 2.9 times the standard model (SM) prediction, with an
  expected limit of 2.4 assuming no Higgs boson pair production. Constraints on the
  Higgs boson self-coupling modifier κ_{λ}=λ_{HHH}/λ_{HHH}^{SM}, and the quartic HHVV
