description: The genomics era has facilitated discovery of new genes predisposing
  to bone marrow failure (BMF) and hematological malignancy (HM). We report the discovery
  of ERG as a novel autosomal dominant BMF/HM predisposition gene. ERG is a highly
  constrained transcription factor critical for definitive hematopoiesis, stem cell
  function and platelet maintenance. ERG colocalizes with other transcription factors
  including RUNX1 and GATA2 on promoters/enhancers of genes orchestrating hematopoiesis.
