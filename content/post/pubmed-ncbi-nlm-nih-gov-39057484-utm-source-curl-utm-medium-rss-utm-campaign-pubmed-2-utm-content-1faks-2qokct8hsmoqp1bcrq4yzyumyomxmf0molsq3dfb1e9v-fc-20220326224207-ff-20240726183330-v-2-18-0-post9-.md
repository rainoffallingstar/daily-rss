description: Biomechanical tests typically involve bending, compression, or shear
  stress, while fall tests are less common. The main challenge in performing fall
  tests is the non-reproducible directionality of bone when tested with soft tissue.
  Upon removal of the soft tissue, the explanted bone's resistance to impact diminishes.
  Therefore, ballistic gels can fix specimens in reproducible directions and simulate
  periosteal soft tissue. However, the use of ballistic gels in biomechanical studies
  is ...
