description: Sleep discrepancy (negative discrepancy reflects worse self-reported
  sleep than objective measures, such as actigraphy, and positive discrepancy the
  opposite) has been linked to adverse health outcomes. This study is first to investigate
  the relationship between sleep discrepancy and brain glucose metabolism (assessed
  globally and regionally via positron emission tomography), and to evaluate the contribution
  of insomnia severity and depressive symptoms to any associations. Using data ...
