description: The maintenance of cellular redox balance is crucial for cell survival
  and homeostasis and is disrupted with aging. Selenoproteins, comprising essential
  antioxidant enzymes, raise intriguing questions about their involvement in hematopoietic
  aging and potential reversibility. Motivated by our observation of mRNA downregulation
  of key antioxidant selenoproteins in aged human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)
  and previous findings of increased lipid peroxidation in aged hematopoiesis, we
