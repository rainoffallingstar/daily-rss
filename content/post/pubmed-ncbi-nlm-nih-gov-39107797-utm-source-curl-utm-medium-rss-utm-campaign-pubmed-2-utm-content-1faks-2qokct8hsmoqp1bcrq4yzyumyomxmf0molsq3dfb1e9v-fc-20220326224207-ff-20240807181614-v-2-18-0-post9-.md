description: Sonic hedgehog subgroup of medulloblastoma (SHH-MB) is characterized
  by aberrant activation of the SHH signaling pathway. An inhibition of the positive
  SHH regulator Smoothened (SMO) has demonstrated promising clinical efficacy. Yet,
  primary and acquired resistance to SMO inhibitors limit their efficacy. An understanding
  of underlying molecular mechanisms of resistance to therapy is warranted to bridge
  this unmet need. Here, we make use of genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens in
