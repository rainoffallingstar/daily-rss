description: The vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) and their receptors (VEGFRs)
  are key regulators of blood vessel formation, including in tumors, where their deregulated
  function can promote the production of aberrant, leaky blood vessels, supporting
  tumor development. Here we investigated the VEGFR1 ligand VEGF-B, which we demonstrate
  to be expressed in tumor cells and in tumor stroma and vasculature across a range
  of tumor types. We examined the anti-VEGF-B-specific monoclonal antibody 2H10 ...
