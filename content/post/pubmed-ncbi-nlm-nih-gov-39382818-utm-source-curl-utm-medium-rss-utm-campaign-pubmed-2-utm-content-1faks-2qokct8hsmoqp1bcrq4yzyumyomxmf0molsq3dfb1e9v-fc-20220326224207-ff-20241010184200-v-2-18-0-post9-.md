description: The growing use of artificial neural network (ANN) tools for computed
  tomography angiography (CTA) data analysis underscores the necessity for elevated
  data protection measures. We aimed to establish an automated defacing pipeline for
  CTA data. In this retrospective study, CTA data from multi-institutional cohorts
  were utilized to annotate facemasks (n = 100) and train an ANN model, subsequently
  tested on an external institution's dataset (n = 50) and compared to a publicly
  available ...
