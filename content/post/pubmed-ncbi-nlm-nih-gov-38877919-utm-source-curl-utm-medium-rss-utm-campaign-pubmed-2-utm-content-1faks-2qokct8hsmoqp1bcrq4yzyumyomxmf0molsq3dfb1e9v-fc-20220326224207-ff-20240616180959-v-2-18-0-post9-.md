description: K^{+}K^{-} pairs may be produced in photonuclear collisions, either from
  the decays of photoproduced ϕ(1020) mesons or directly as nonresonant K^{+}K^{-}
  pairs. Measurements of K^{+}K^{-} photoproduction probe the couplings between the
  ϕ(1020) and charged kaons with photons and nuclear targets. The kaon-proton scattering
  occurs at energies far above those available elsewhere. We present the first measurement
  of coherent photoproduction of K^{+}K^{-} pairs on lead ions in ...
