description: The liver has a strong regenerative capacity that ensures patient recovery
  after hepatectomy and liver transplantation. The portal system plays a crucial role
  in the dual blood supply to the liver, making it a significant factor in hepatic
  function. Several surgical strategies, such as portal vein ligation, associating
  liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy, and dual vein embolization,
  have highlighted the portal system's importance in liver regeneration. ...
