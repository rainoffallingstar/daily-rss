description: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are age-related diseases characterized
  by bone marrow (BM) dysfunction and an increased risk of developing acute leukemia.
  While there is growing evidence highlighting the crucial role of the BM microenvironment
  (BMME) in MDS, the specific influence of inflammation on BMME changes, as well as
  the potential benefits of targeting cytokines therapeutically, remain to be elucidated.
  We previously found interleukin-1 (IL-1) to be a driver of aging phenotypes of ...
