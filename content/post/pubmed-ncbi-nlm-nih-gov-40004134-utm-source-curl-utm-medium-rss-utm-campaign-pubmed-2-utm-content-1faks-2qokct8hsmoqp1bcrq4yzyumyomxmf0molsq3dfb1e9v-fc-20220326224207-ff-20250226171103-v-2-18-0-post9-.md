description: A growing body of evidence indicates that nonglycemic effects of sodium-glucose
  cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors play an important role in the protective effects
  of these drugs in diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure. In recent
  years, the anti-inflammatory potential of SGLT2 inhibitors has been actively studied.
  This review summarizes results of clinical and experimental studies on the anti-inflammatory
  activity of SGLT2 inhibitors, with a special focus on their effects ...
