description: The Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) is widely used
  for assessing the severity and progression of genetic cerebellar ataxias. SARA is
  now considered a primary end point in several ataxia treatment trials, but its underlying
  composite item measurement model has not yet been tested. This work aimed to evaluate
  the composite properties of SARA and its items using item response theory (IRT)
  and to demonstrate its applicability across even ultra-rare genetic ataxias. ...
