description: 'The aim of this study was to validate a previously developed deep learning
  model in 5 independent clinical trials. The predictive performance of this model
  was compared with the international prognostic index (IPI) and 2 models incorporating
  radiomic PET/CT features (clinical PET and PET models). Methods: In total, 1,132
