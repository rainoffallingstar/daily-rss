description: Herein, we disclose a novel, mild, transition-metal-free approach to
  synthesizing diversely functionalized isothiocyanates from the corresponding isocyanide
  precursors, achieving high to excellent yields (up to 97%). The current method sheds
  light on the reactivity of pyridinium 1,4-zwitterionic thiolates as an unprecedented
  sulfur source strikingly distinct from their previously known reactivity in ionic
  annulation reactions, showcasing an innovative approach to organic ...
