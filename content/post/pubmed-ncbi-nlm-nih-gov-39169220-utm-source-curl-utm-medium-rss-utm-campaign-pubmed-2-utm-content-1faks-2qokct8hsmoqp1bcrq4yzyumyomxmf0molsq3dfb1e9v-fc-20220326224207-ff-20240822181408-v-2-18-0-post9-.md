description: Treatment of the tumor and dural margin with surgery and sometimes radiation
  are cornerstones of therapy for meningioma. Molecular classifications have provided
  insights into the biology of disease; however, response to treatment remains heterogeneous.
  In this study, we used retrospective data on 2,824 meningiomas, including molecular
  data on 1,686 tumors and 100 prospective meningiomas, from the RTOG-0539 phase 2
  trial to define molecular biomarkers of treatment response. Using propensity ...
