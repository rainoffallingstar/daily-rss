description: The nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) pathway is a crucial mechanism
  of mRNA quality control. Current annotations of NMD substrate RNAs are rarely data-driven,
  but use general established rules. We present a dataset with 4 cell lines and combinations
  for SMG5, SMG6 and SMG7 knockdowns or SMG7 knockout. Based on this dataset, we implemented
  a workflow that combines Nanopore and Illumina sequencing to assemble a transcriptome,
  which is enriched for NMD target transcripts. Moreover, we use ...
