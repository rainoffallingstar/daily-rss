description: Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a highly prevalent phenomenon in adolescence,
  often associated with prior traumatic experiences. The development and maintenance
  of NSSI is associated with dysregulation of the stress response, and evidence suggests
  that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis plays an important role. The
  endocannabinoid system is a neuromodulatory system in close functional interaction
  with the HPA axis. Several studies have reported alterations of the ...
