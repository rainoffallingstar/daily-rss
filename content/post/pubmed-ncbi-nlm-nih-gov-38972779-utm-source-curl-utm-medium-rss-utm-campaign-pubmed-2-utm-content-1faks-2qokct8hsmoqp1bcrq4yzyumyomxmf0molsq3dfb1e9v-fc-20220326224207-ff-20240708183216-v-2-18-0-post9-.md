description: Protein misfolding and mislocalization are common to both familial and
  sporadic forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Maintaining proteostasis
  through induction of heat shock proteins (HSP) to increase chaperoning capacity
  is a rational therapeutic strategy in the treatment of ALS. However, the threshold
  for upregulating stress-inducible HSPs remains high in neurons, presenting a therapeutic
  obstacle. This study used mouse models expressing the ALS variants FUS^(R521G) or
  SOD1^(G93A) ...
