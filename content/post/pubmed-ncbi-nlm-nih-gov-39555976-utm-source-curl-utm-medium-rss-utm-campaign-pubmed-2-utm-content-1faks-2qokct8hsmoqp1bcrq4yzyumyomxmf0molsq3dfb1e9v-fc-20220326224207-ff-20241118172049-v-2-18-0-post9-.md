description: Hyperpolarized (HP) ^(13)C-labeled probes are emerging as promising agents
  to noninvasively image pH in vivo. HP [1,5-^(13)C(2)]Z-OMPD (Z-4-methyl-2-oxopent-3-enedioic
  acid) in particular has recently been used to simultaneously report on kidney perfusion,
  filtration, and pH homeostasis, in addition to the ability to detect local tumor
  acidification. In previous studies, dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization was
  used to hyperpolarize Z-OMPD. Here, we pioneered the hyperpolarization ...
