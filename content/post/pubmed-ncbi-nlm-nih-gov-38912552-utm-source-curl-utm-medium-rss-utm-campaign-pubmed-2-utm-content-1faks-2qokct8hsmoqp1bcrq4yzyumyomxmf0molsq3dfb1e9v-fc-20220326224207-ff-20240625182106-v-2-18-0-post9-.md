description: The field of developmental metabolism is experiencing a technological
  revolution that is opening entirely new fields of inquiry. Advances in metabolomics,
  small-molecule sensors, single-cell RNA sequencing and computational modeling present
  new opportunities for exploring cell-specific and tissue-specific metabolic networks,
  interorgan metabolic communication, and gene-by-metabolite interactions in time
  and space. Together, these advances not only present a means by which ...
