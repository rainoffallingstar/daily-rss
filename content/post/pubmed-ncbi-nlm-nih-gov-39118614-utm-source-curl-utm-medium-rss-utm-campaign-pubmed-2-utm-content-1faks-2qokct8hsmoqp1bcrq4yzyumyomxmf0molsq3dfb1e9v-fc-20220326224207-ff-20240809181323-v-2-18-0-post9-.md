description: We report herein a direct and practical synthesis of arylsulfonamides
  from electron-rich aromatic compounds by using in situ generated N-sulfonylamine
  as the active electrophile. Substrates include derivatives of aniline, indole, pyrrole,
  furan, styrene and so on. The reaction proceeds under mild conditions and tolerates
  many sensitive functional groups such as alkyne, acetate, the trifluoromethoxy group
  or acetoxymethyl ester. Applications of this method for the construction of metal
