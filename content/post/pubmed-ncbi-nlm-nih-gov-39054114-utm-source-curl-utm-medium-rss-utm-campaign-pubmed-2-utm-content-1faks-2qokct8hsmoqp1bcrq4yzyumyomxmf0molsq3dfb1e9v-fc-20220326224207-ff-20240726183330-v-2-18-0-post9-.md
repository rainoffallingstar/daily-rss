description: Myeloid cells that populate all human organs and blood are a versatile
  class of innate immune cells. They are crucial for sensing and regulating processes
  as diverse as tissue homeostasis and inflammation and are frequently characterized
  by their roles in either regulating or promoting inflammation. Recent studies in
  cultured cells and mouse models highlight the role of iron in skewing the functional
  properties of myeloid cells in tissue damage and repair. Here, we review certain
