description: The capability of cells to sense and respond to endogenous electrical
  fields plays a crucial role in processes like nerve regeneration, wound healing,
  and development. In vitro, many cell types respond to electrical fields by migrating
  along the corresponding electrical field vectors. This process is known as galvano-
  or electrotaxis. Here we report on the combined impact of micro-confinements and
  direct current electrical fields (dcEFs) on the motility of MDA-MB-231 human breast
  cancer ...
