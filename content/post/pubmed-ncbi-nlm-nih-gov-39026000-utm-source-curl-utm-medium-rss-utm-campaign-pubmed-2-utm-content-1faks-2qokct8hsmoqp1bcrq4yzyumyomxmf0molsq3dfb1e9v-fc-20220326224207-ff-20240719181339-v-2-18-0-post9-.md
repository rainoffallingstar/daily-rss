description: The cellular cortex provides crucial mechanical support and plays critical
  roles during cell division and migration. The proteins of the ERM family, comprised
  of ezrin, radixin, and moesin, are central to these processes by linking the plasma
  membrane to the actin cytoskeleton. To investigate the contributions of the ERM
  proteins to leukocyte migration, we generated single and triple ERM knockout macrophages.
  Surprisingly, we found that even in the absence of ERM proteins, macrophages still
