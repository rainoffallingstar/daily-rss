description: Human leucocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) molecules play a central role
  for both NK and T-cell responses that prevent serious human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)
  disease. To create opportunities for viral spread, several HCMV-encoded immunoevasins
  employ diverse strategies to target HLA-I. Among these, the glycoprotein US10 is
  so far insufficiently studied. While it was reported that US10 interferes with HLA-G
  expression, its ability to manipulate classical HLA-I antigen presentation remains
  unknown. ...
