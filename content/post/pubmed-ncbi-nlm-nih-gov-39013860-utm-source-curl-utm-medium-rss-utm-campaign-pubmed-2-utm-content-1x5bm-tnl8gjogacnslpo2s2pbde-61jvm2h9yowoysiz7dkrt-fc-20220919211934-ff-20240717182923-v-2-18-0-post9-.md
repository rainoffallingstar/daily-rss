description: Single-cell sequencing is frequently affected by "omission" due to limitations
  in sequencing throughput, yet bulk RNA-seq may contain these ostensibly "omitted"
  cells. Here, we introduce the single cell trajectory blending from Bulk RNA-seq
  (BulkTrajBlend) algorithm, a component of the OmicVerse suite that leverages a Beta-Variational
  AutoEncoder for data deconvolution and graph neural networks for the discovery of
  overlapping communities. This approach effectively interpolates and restores ...
