description: Leukemia is a rare but fatal cancer of the blood. This cancer arises
  from abnormal bone marrow cells and requires prompt diagnosis for effective treatment
  and positive patient prognosis. Traditional diagnostic methods (e.g., microscopy,
  flow cytometry, and biopsy) pose challenges in both accuracy and time, demanding
  an inquisition on the development and use of deep learning (DL) models, such as
  convolutional neural networks (CNN), which could allow for a faster and more exact
  diagnosis. ...
