description: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a prevalent posttranscriptional mRNA modification
  involved in the regulation of transcript turnover, translation, and other aspects
  of RNA fate. The modification is mediated by multicomponent methyltransferase complexes
  (so-called writers) and is reversed through the action of the m6A-demethylases fat
  mass and obesity-associated (FTO) and alkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5) (so-called erasers).
  FTO promotes cell proliferation, colony formation and metastasis in models ...
