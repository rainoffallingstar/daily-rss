description: In recent years, synthetic Computed Tomography (CT) images generated
  from Magnetic Resonance (MR) or Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) acquisitions
  have been shown to be comparable to real CT images in terms of dose computation
  for radiotherapy simulation. However, until now, there has been no independent strategy
  to assess the quality of each synthetic image in the absence of ground truth. In
