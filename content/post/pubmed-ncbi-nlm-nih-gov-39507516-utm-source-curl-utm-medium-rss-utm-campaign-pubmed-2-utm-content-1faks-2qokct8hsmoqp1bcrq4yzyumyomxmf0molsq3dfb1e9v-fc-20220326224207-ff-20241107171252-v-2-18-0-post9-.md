description: This paper is a write-up of the ideas that were presented, developed
  and discussed at the fourth International Workshop on QCD Challenges from pp to
  AA, which took place in February 2023 in Padua, Italy. The goal of the workshop
  was to focus on some of the open questions in the field of high-energy heavy-ion
  physics and to stimulate the formulation of concrete suggestions for making progresses
  on both the experimental and theoretical sides. The paper gives a brief introduction
  to each topic ...
