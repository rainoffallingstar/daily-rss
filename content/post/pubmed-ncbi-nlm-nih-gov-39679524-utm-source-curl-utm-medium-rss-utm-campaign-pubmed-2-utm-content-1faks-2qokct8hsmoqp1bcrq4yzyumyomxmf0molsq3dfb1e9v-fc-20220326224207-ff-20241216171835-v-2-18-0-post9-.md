description: Nonadiabatic quantum-classical mapping approaches have significantly
  gained in popularity over the past several decades because they have acceptable
  accuracy while remaining numerically tractable even for large system sizes. In the
  recent few years, several novel mapping approaches have been developed that display
  higher accuracy than the traditional Ehrenfest method, linearized semiclassical
  initial value representation (LSC-IVR), and Poisson bracket mapping equation (PBME)
  approaches. ...
