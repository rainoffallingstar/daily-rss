description: Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has become a standard anti-cancer treatment,
  offering durable clinical benefits. However, the limited response rate of ICB necessitates
  biomarkers to predict and modulate the efficacy of the therapy. The gut microbiome's
  influence on ICB efficacy is of particular interest due to its modifiability through
  various interventions. However, gut microbiome biomarkers for ICB response have
  been inconsistent across different studies. Here, we identify TANB77, ...
