description: The oncogenes yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator
  with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are potent liver oncogenes. Because gene mutations
  cannot fully explain their nuclear enrichment, we aim to understand which mechanisms
  cause YAP/TAZ activation in liver cancer cells. The combination of proteomics and
