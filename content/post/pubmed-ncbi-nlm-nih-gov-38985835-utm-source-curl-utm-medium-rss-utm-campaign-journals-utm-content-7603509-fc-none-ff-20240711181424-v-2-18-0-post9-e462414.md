description: Red blood cells (RBCs) have been hypothesized to support hemostasis by
  facilitating platelet margination and releasing platelet-activating factors such
  as adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Significant knowledge gaps remain regarding how
  RBCs influence platelet function, especially in (patho)physiologically relevant
  hemodynamic conditions. Here we present results showing how RBCs affect platelet
  function and hemostasis in conditions of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia,
  and how ...
