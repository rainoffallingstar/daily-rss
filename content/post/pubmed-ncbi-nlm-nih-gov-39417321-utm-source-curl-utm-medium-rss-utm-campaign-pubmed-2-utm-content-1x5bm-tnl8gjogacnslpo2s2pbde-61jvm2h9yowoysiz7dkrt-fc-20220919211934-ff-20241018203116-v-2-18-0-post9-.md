description: The gene regulatory network (GRN) plays a vital role in understanding
  the structure and dynamics of cellular systems, revealing complex regulatory relationships,
  and exploring disease mechanisms. Recently, deep learning (DL)-based methods have
  been proposed to infer GRNs from single-cell transcriptomic data and achieved impressive
  performance. However, these methods do not fully utilize graph topological information
  and high-order neighbor information from multiple receptive fields. To ...
