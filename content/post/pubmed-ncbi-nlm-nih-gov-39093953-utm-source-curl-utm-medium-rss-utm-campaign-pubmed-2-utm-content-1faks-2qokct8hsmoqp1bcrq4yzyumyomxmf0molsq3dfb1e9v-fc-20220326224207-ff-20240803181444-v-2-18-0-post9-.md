description: For several decades, induction therapy with nucleoside analogs, in particular
  cytarabine (Ara-C) and, to a lesser extent, fludarabine, has been the standard of
  care for patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Still, the anti-tumor
  efficacy of nucleoside analogs is often limited by intrinsic and acquired drug resistance,
  thereby leading to poor therapeutic response and suboptimal clinical outcomes. Here,
  we used genome-wide CRISPR-based pharmacogenomic screening to map the ...
