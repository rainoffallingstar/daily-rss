description: This roadmap reviews the new, highly interdisciplinary research field
  studying the behavior of condensed matter systems exposed to radiation. The Review
  highlights several recent advances in the field and provides a roadmap for the development
  of the field over the next decade. Condensed matter systems exposed to radiation
  can be inorganic, organic, or biological, finite or infinite, composed of different
  molecular species or materials, exist in different phases, and operate under ...
