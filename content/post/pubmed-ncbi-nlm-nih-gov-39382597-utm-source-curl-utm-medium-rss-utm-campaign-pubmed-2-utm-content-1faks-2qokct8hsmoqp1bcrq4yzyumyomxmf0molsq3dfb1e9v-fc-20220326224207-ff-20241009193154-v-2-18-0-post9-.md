  associated with vascular diseases. Current knowledge of the specific variants is
  insufficient to classify them as pathogenic at the present time, underlining the
  need for a better understanding of the consequences of genetic variants. WES should
  be considered for patients with multiple arterial aneurysms to detect germline variants
  and to improve clinical management for the individual and family ...'
