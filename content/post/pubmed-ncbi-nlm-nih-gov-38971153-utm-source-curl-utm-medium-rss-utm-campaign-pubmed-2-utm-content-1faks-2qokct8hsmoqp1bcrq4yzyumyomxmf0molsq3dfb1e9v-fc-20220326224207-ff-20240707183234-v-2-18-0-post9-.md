description: The intestine constantly encounters and adapts to the external environment
  shaped by diverse dietary nutrients. However, whether and how gut adaptability to
  dietary challenges is compromised in ulcerative colitis is incompletely understood.
  Here, we show that a transient high-fat diet exacerbates colitis owing to inflammation-compromised
  bile acid tolerance. Mechanistically, excessive tumor necrosis factor (TNF) produced
  at the onset of colitis interferes with bile-acid detoxification ...
