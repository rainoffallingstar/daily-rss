description: Two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) is an important greenhouse
  pest. In cucumbers, heavy infestations lead to the complete loss of leaf assimilation
  surface, resulting in plant death. Symptoms caused by spider mite feeding alter
  the light reflection of leaves and could therefore be optically detected. Machine
  learning methods have already been employed to analyze spectral information in order
  to differentiate between healthy and spider mite-infested leaves of crops such as
  tomatoes ...
