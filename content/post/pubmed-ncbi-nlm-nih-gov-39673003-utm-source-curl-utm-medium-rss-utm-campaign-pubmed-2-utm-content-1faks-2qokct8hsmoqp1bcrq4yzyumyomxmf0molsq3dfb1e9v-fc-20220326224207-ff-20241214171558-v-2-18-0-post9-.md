description: Dipeptides (DPs), composed of two amino acids (AAs), hold significant
  therapeutic potential but remain underexplored. Given the crucial role of AAs in
  central nervous system (CNS) function, this study investigated the presence of DPs
  in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and their correlation with corresponding AAs, potentially
  indicating their role as AA donors. Plasma and CSF samples were collected from 43
  children with neurological or metabolic conditions of unknown origin, including
  23 with ...
