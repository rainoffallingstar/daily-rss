description: T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive malignancy
  characterized by an expansion of T-cell progenitors and DNA mutations that lead
  to an overactive NOTCH1 signaling in over 50% of T-ALL cases. Using synthetic models
  of human T-ALL, we report that NOTCH1 dimeric signaling was crucial for the leukemogenesis
  of human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from cord blood. We also identified
  a Notch-dimerization-dependent gene signature, including HES4 transcription ...
