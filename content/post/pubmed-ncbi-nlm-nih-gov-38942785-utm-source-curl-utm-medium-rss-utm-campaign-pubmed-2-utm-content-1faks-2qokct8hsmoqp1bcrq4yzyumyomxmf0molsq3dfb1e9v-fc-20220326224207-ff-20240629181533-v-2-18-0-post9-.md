description: RNA constitutes a large fraction of chromatin. Spatial distribution and
  functional relevance of most of RNA-chromatin interactions remain unknown. We established
  a landscape analysis of RNA-chromatin interactions in human acute myeloid leukemia
  (AML). In total more than 50 million interactions were captured in an AML cell line.
  Protein-coding mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs exhibited a substantial number of
  interactions with chromatin in cis suggesting transcriptional activity. In contrast,
