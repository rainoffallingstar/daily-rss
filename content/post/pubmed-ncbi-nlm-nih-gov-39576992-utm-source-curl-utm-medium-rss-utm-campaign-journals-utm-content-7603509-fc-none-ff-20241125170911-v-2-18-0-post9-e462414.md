description: Thromboembolic complication is common in severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19),
  leading to an investigation into the presence of prothrombotic antibodies akin to
  those found in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). In a study of samples from
  130 hospitalized patients collected 3.6 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, 80% had IgG
  antibodies recognizing complexes of heparin and platelet factor 4 (PF4/H), and 41%
  had antibodies inducing PF4-dependent P-selectin expression in CpG-treated ...
