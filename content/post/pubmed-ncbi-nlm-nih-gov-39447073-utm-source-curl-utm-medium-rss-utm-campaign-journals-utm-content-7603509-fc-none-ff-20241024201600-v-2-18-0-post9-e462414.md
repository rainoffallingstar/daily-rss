description: The structure of human coagulation factor XIII (FXIII), a heterotetrameric
  plasma pro-transglutaminase that covalently crosslinks pre-formed fibrin polymers,
  remains elusive until today. The heterotetrameric complex is composed of two catalytic
  FXIII-A and two protective FXIII-B subunits. Structural etiology underlying FXIII
  deficiency has so far been derived from crystallographic structures, all of which
  are currently available for the FXIII-A2 homodimer only. Here, we present the ...
