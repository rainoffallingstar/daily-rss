description: There are large differences in premature mortality in the USA by race/ethnicity,
  education, rurality and social vulnerability index groups. Using existing concentration-response
  functions, published particulate matter (PM(2.5)) air pollution estimates, population
  estimates at the census tract level and county-level mortality data from the US
  National Vital Statistics System, we estimated the degree to which these mortality
  discrepancies can be attributed to differences in exposure ...
