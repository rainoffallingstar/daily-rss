description: In epidemiological studies, lowered serum testosterone concentrations
  are common in men with obesity, prediabetes, and established type 2 diabetes (T2D).
  In men with prediabetes, lowered serum testosterone also predicts a future risk
  of T2D in men. Administration of testosterone consistently reduces fat mass and
  increases skeletal muscle mass-body compositional changes expected to be metabolically
  favorable. In men with established T2D, the effects of testosterone treatment on
