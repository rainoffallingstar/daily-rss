description: Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is a B cell-specific mutator
  required for antibody diversification. However, it is also implicated in the etiology
  of several B cell malignancies. Evaluating the AID-induced mutation load in patients
  at-risk for certain blood cancers is critical in assessing disease severity and
  treatment options. We have developed a digital PCR (dPCR) assay that allows us to
  quantify mutations resulting from AID modification or DNA double-strand break (DSB)
