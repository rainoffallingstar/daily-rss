description: The pivotal role of the cell entry receptor ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 infection
  is well-established. When ACE2 is shed from cell surface into plasma as soluble
  ACE2 (sACE2), it can effectively neutralize SARS-CoV-2. This longitudinal prospective
  cohort study analyzed sACE2 activity in 1192 participants, aged 4 months to 81 years,
  3 and 12 months after SARS-CoV-2 household exposure. Following SARS-CoV-2 exposure,
  participants exhibited significantly elevated sACE2 activity, irrespective of ...
