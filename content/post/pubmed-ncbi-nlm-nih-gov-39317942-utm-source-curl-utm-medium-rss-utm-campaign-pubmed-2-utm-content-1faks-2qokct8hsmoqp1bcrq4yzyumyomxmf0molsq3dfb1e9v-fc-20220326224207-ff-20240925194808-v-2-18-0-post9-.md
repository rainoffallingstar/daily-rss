description: 'CONCLUSION: On-treatment biopsies can predict patients unlikely to achieve
  pCR post-therapy. This could facilitate therapy adjustments for TNBC or HER2 + BC.
  They also might offer insights into therapy resistance mechanisms. Future research
  should explore whether standardized or expanded sampling enhances the accuracy of
  on-treatment biopsy procedures. Trial registration GeparQuattro (EudraCT 2005-001546-17),
