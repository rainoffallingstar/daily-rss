description: Metaplastic thymoma (MT), a rare subtype of thymic epithelial tumors
  (TETs), harbors YAP1::MAML2 fusions. Poroma, a skin tumor, also carries these fusions
  and exhibits a unique staining pattern for YAP1 immunohistochemistry (IHC), namely,
  a YAP1 N-terminus (YAP1[N])-positive but YAP1 C-terminus (YAP1[C])-negative pattern.
  In this context, MT was recently reported to lack YAP1(C) expression exclusively
  among TET subtypes. However, a lack of information about YAP1(N) expression in that
  study ...
