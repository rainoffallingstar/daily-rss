description: Bacterial cell division and plant chloroplast division require selfassembling
  Filamentous temperature-sensitive Z (FtsZ) proteins. FtsZ proteins are GTPases sharing
  structural and biochemical similarities with eukaryotic tubulin. In the moss Physcomitrella,
  the morphology of the FtsZ polymer networks varies between the different FtsZ isoforms.
  The underlying mechanism and foundation of the distinct networks is unknown. Here,
  we investigated the interaction of Physcomitrella FtsZ2-1 with ...
