description: ConspectusUnlike carbon, boron does not usually form ring compounds due
  to its electron-deficiency-driven affinity toward polyhedral geometries. The polyhedral
  boranes having closo-, nido-, arachno-, or hypho-shapes can be structurally and
  electronically correlated using various electron counting rules developed by Wade,
  Mingos, and one of us. However, in the last few decades, boron chemistry progressed
  significantly toward ring systems. In this regard, three of our research groups
  have ...
