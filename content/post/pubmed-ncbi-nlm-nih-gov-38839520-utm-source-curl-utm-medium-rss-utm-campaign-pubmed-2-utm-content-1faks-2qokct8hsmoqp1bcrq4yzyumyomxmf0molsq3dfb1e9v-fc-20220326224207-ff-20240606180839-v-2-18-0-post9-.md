description: The design of prophylactic and diagnostic tools specific to animal papillomaviruses
  is hampered by the difficulties of viral in vitro manipulation and by the scarce
  availability of dedicated biotechnological tools. This paper reports the production
  of Ovine Papillomavirus 3 (OaPV3)-based virus-like particles (OaPV3-VLPs) in the
  baculovirus system and their use to investigate host humoral immune response through
  the establishment of an indirect ELISA test., Polyclonal sera and ...
