description: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is characterized
  by biomechanically dysfunctional cardiomyocytes. Underlying cellular changes include
  perturbed myocardial titin expression and titin hypophosphorylation leading to titin
  filament stiffening. Beside these well-studied alterations at the cardiomyocyte
  level, exercise intolerance is another hallmark of HFpEF caused by molecular alterations
  in skeletal muscle (SKM). Currently, there is a lack of data regarding titin ...
