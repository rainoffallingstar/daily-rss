description: Activity has long been considered essential for circuit formation and
  maintenance. This view has recently been challenged by proper synaptogenesis and
  only mildly affected synapse maintenance in the absence of synaptic activity in
  forebrain neurons. Here, we investigated whether synaptic activity is necessary
  for the development and maintenance of the calyx of Held synapse. This giant synapse
  located in the auditory brainstem is highly specialized to maintain high frequency,
