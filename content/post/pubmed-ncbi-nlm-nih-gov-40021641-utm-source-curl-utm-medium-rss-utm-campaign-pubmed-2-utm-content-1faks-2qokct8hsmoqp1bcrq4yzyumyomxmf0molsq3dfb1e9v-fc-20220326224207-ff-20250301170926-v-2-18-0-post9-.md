description: The photochemistry of heterocyclic molecules plays a decisive role for
  processes and applications like DNA photo-protection from UV damage and organic
  photocatalysis. The photochemical reactivity of heterocycles is determined by the
  redistribution of photoenergy into electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom, initially
  involving ultrafast internal conversion. Most heterocycles are planar in their ground
  state and internal conversion requires symmetry breaking. To lower the symmetry,
  the ...
