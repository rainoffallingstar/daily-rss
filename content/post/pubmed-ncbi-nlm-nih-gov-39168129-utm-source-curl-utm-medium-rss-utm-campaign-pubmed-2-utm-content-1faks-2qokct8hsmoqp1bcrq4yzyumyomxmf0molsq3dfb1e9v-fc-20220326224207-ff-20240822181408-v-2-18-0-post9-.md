description: Memory B cells (MBCs) formed over the individual's lifetime constitute
  nearly half of the circulating B cell repertoire in humans. These pre-existing MBCs
  dominate recall responses to their cognate antigens, but how they respond to recognition
  of novel antigens is not well understood. Here, we tracked the origin and followed
  the differentiation paths of MBCs in the early anti-spike (S) response to mRNA vaccination
  in SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals on single-cell and monoclonal antibody ...
