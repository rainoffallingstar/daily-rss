description: In a randomized phase II trial (AMLSG 14-09, NCT00867672) of elderly,
  newly diagnosed AML patients, ATRA combined with decitabine (DEC) significantly
  improved the overall response rate (ORR) and survival also in patients with adverse-risk
  genetics, without adding toxicity. We performed a post hoc analysis to determine
  the predictive impact of TP53 status. Despite a nominally higher ORR, the clinically
  meaningful survival benefit when adding ATRA to DEC was diminished, but not completely
