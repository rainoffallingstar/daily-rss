description: The interplay between T-cell states of differentiation, dysfunction,
  and treatment response in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unclear. Here, we
  leveraged a multimodal approach encompassing high-dimensional flow cytometry and
  single-cell transcriptomics and found that early memory CD8+ T cells are associated
  with therapy response and exhibit a bifurcation into two distinct terminal end states.
  One state is enriched for markers of activation, whereas the other expresses NK-like
