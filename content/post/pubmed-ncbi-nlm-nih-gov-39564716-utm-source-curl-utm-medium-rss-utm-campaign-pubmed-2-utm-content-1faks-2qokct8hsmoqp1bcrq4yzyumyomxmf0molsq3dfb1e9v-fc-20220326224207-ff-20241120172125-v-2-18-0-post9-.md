description: Proteomic analysis of sperm cells offers significant insights into proteins'
  structural, functional, and localization aspects within biological systems. Sahiwal,
  a native Indian cattle breed, is well known for its disease resistance, calving
  ease, and resilience to drought. This study addressed the gap in Sahiwal's comprehensive
  sperm proteome profiling data. The research involved the global in-silico quantitative
  high-resolution mass spectrometry-based protein profiling of Indian Zebu ...
