description: Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi) have transformed the treatment
  of B-cell malignancies, but intolerance has often led to their discontinuation.
  The phase 1/2 BRUIN study evaluated pirtobrutinib, a highly selective non-covalent
  (reversible) BTKi, in patients with R/R B-cell malignancies (NCT03740529). Pirtobrutinib
  was investigated in 127 patients with intolerance to at least one prior BTKi therapy
  in the absence of progressive disease. The most common adverse event (AE) leading
