description: Functionalized lipid probes are a critical new tool to interrogate the
  function of individual lipid species, but the structural parameters that constrain
  their utility have not been thoroughly described. Here, we synthesize three palmitic
  acid derivatives with a diazirine at different positions on the acyl chain and examine
  their metabolism, subcellular localization, and protein interactions. We demonstrate
  that while they produce very similar metabolites and subcellular distributions,
