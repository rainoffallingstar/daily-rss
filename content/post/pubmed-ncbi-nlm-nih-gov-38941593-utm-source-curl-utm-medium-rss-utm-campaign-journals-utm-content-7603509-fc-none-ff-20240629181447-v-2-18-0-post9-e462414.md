description: Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV)-associated disorders include Kaposi
  sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), KSHV-associated multicentric Castleman
  disease (MCD) and KSHV-inflammatory cytokine syndrome (KICS). PEL, MCD, and KICS
  are associated with elevated circulating inflammatory cytokines. However, activation
  of the inflammasome, which generates IL-1 and IL-18 via active caspase-1/4/5, has
  not been evaluated in patients with KAD. Here we report that patients with HIV and
