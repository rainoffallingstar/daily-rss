description: The deep Southern Ocean (SO) circulation plays a key role in the storage
  and release of CO(2) in Earth's climate system. The uptake and release of CO(2)
  strongly depend on the redistribution of well and poorly ventilated deep ocean water
  masses. Recently, evidence was found for possible stronger Pacific deep water overturning
  and subsequent intrusion into the SO during periods of reduced AMOC. Here, we present
  new authigenic neodymium isotope data (ɛNd) from two sites within the Atlantic ...
