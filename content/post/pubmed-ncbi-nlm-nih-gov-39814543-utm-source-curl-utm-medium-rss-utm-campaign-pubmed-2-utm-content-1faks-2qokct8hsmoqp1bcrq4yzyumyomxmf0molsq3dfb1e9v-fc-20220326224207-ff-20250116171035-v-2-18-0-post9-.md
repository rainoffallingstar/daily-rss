description: 'Background: Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction is suggested to be
  a potential mediator between vascular risk factors and cognitive impairment, leading
  to vascular cognitive impairment. Objective: To investigate the relationships between
  age, sex, and vascular risk factors and BBB water permeability as well as their
  relationship with cognition. Methods: To measure BBB permeability, a novel arterial
  spin labelling MRI technique (ME-ASL) was applied to derive the time of exchange
