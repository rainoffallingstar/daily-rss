description: Interatomic Coulombic decay (ICD) plays a crucial role in weakly bound
  complexes exposed to intense or high-energy radiation. So far, neutral or ionic
  atoms or molecules have been prepared in singly excited electron or hole states
  that can transfer energy to neighboring centers and cause ionization and radiation
  damage. Here we demonstrate that a doubly excited atom, despite its extremely short
  lifetime, can decay by ICD; evidenced by high-resolution photoelectron spectra of
