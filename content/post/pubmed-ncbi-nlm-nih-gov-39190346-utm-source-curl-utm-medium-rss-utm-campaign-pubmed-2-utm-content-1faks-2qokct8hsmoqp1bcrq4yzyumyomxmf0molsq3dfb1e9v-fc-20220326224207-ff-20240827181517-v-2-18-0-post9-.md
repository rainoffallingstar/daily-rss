description: Synchronization of coupled oscillators is a universal phenomenon encountered
  across different scales and contexts, e.g., chemical wave patterns, superconductors,
  and the unison applause we witness in concert halls. The existence of common underlying
  coupling rules defines universality classes, revealing a fundamental sameness between
  seemingly distinct systems. Identifying rules of synchronization in any particular
  setting is hence of paramount relevance. Here, we address the coupling ...
