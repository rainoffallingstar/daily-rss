description: A wide variety of engineered and natural systems are modeled as networks
  of coupled nonlinear oscillators. In nature, the intrinsic frequencies of these
  oscillators are not constant in time. Here, we probe the effect of such a temporal
  heterogeneity on coupled oscillator networks through the lens of the Kuramoto model.
  To do this, we shuffle repeatedly the intrinsic frequencies among the oscillators
  at either random or regular time intervals. What emerges is the remarkable effect
