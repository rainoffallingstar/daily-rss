description: Among patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplants, infections,
  particularly multidrug-resistant infections, pose a grave threat. In this setting,
  penicillin allergy labels are both common and harmful. Though the majority of patients
  who report penicillin allergy can actually tolerate penicillin, penicillin allergy
  labels are associated with use of alternative antibiotics, which are often more
  broad spectrum, less effective, and more toxic. In turn, they are associated with
