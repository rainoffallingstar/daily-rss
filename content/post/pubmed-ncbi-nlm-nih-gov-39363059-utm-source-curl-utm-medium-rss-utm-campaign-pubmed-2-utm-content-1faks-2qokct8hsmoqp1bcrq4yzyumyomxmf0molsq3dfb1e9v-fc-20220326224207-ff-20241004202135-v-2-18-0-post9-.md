description: TLR8 senses single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) fragments, processed via cleavage
  by ribonuclease (RNase) T2 and RNase A family members. Processing by these RNases
  releases uridines and purine-terminated residues resulting in TLR8 activation. Monocytes
  show high expression of RNase 6, yet this RNase has not been analyzed for its physiological
  contribution to the recognition of bacterial RNA by TLR8. Here, we show a role for
