description: Multi-photon 3D laser printing has gathered much attention in recent
  years as a means of manufacturing biocompatible scaffolds that can modify and guide
  cellular behavior in vitro. However, in vivo tissue engineering efforts have been
  limited so far to the implantation of beforehand 3D printed biocompatible scaffolds
  and in vivo bioprinting of tissue constructs from bioinks containing cells, biomolecules,
  and printable hydrogel formulations. Thus, a comprehensive 3D laser printing platform
