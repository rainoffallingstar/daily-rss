description: The phenomenon of mixed/heterogenous treatment responses to cancer therapies
  within an individual patient presents a challenging clinical scenario. Furthermore,
  the molecular basis of mixed intra-patient tumor responses remains unclear. Here,
  we show that patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma harbouring co-mutations
  of EGFR and TP53, are more likely to have mixed intra-patient tumor responses to
  EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition (TKI), compared to those with an EGFR mutation alone.
