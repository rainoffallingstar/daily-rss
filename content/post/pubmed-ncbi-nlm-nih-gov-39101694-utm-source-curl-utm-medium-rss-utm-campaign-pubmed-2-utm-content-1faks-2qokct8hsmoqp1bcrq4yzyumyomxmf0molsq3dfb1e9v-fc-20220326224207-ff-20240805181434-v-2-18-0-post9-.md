description: Here, we report the synthesis of the 6-(6-methyl-1,2,4,5-tetrazine-3-yl)-2,2'-bipyridine
  (MTB) ligand that has been developed for lanthanide/actinide separation. A multimethod
  study of the complexation of MTB with trivalent actinide and lanthanide ions is
  presented. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements reveal the formation of
  [Ce(MTB)(2)(NO(3))(3)], [Pr(MTB)(NO(3))(3)H(2)O], and [Ln(MTB)(NO(3))(3)MeCN] (Ln
  = Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd). In addition, the complexation of Cm(III) with MTB in ...
