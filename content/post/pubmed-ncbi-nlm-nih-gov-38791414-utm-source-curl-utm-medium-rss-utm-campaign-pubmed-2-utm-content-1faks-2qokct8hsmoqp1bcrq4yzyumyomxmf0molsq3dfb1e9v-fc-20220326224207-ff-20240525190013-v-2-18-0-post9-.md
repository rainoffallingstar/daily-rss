description: Chemokines orchestrate many aspects of tumorigenic processes such as
  angiogenesis, apoptosis and metastatic spread, and related receptors are expressed
  on tumor cells as well as on inflammatory cells (e.g., tumor-infiltrating T cells,
  TILs) in the tumor microenvironment. Expressional changes of chemokines and their
  receptors in solid cancers are common and well known, especially in affecting colorectal
  cancer patient outcomes. Therefore, the aim of this current systematic review ...
