description: The intricate dynamics of Hes expression across diverse cell types in
  the developing vertebrate embryonic tail have remained elusive. To address this,
  we developed an endogenously tagged Hes1-Achilles mouse line, enabling precise quantification
  of dynamics at the single-cell resolution across various tissues. Our findings reveal
  striking disparities in Hes1 dynamics between presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and preneural
  tube (pre-NT) cells. While pre-NT cells display variable, ...
