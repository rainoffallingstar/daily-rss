description: Amino acids (AAs) and their metabolites are important building blocks,
  energy sources, and signaling molecules associated with various pathological phenotypes.
  The quantification of AA and tryptophan (TRP) metabolites in human serum and plasma
  is therefore of great diagnostic interest. Therefore, robust, reproducible sample
  extraction and processing workflows as well as rapid, sensitive absolute quantification
  are required to identify candidate biomarkers and to improve screening methods.
