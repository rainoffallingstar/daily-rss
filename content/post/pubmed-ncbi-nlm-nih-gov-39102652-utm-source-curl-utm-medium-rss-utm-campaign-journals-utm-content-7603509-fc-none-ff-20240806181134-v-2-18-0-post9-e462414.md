description: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is common among older individuals, but provoking
  factors are not identified in many cases. Patients with myeloid malignancies, especially
  myeloproliferative neoplasms, are at increased risk for venous thrombosis. Clonal
  hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), a precursor state to myeloid malignancies,
  is common among the elderly and may similarly predispose to venous thrombosis. We
