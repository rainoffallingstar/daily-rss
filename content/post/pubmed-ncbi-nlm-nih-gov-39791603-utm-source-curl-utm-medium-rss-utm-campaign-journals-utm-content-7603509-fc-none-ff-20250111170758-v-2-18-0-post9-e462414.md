description: Cullin-5 (Cul5) coordinates assembly of cullin-RING-E3 ubiquitin (Ub)
  ligase (CRL) complexes that include Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling (SOCS)-box-containing
  proteins. The SOCS-box proteins function to recruit specific substrates to the complex
  for ubiquitination and degradation. In hematopoiesis, SOCS-box proteins are best
  known for regulating the actions of cytokines that utilize the JAK-STAT signaling
  pathway. However, the roles of most SOCS-box proteins have not been studied ...
