description: The design of well-defined assemblies of chiral molecules is a prerequisite
  for numerous applications, such as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). In
  this context, tripodal molecular films bear the advantage of better control of molecular
  orientation and alignment than analogous monopodal systems. To this end, we report
  on the synthesis and assembly property of C3 chiral syn-5,10,15-truxene triacetic
  acid. (S,S,S) and (R,R,R) enantiomers were isolated and adsorbed on ...
