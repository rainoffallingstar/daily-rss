  determined experimentally, computationally predicting the function of proteins is
  critical for obtaining functional information for most proteins and has been a major
  challenge in protein bioinformatics. Despite the significant progress made in protein
  function prediction by the community in the last decade, the general accuracy of
  protein function prediction is still not high, particularly for rare function ...'
