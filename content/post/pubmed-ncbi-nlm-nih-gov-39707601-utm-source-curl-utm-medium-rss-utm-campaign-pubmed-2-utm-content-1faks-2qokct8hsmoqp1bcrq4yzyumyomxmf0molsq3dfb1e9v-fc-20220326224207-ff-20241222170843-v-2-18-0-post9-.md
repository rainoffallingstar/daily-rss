description: The Houge type of X-linked syndromic intellectual developmental disorder
  (MRXSHG) encompasses a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by
  intellectual disability (ID), language/speech delay, attention issues, and epilepsy.
  These conditions arise from hemizygous or heterozygous deletions, along with point
  mutations, affecting CNKSR2, a gene located at Xp22.12. CNKSR2, also known as CNK2
