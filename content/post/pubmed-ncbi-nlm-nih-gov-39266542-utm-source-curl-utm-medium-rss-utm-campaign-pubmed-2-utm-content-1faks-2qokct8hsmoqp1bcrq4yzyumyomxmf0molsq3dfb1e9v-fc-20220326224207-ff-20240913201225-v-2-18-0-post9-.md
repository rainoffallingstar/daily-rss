description: Impaired clearance of amyloid β (Aβ) in late-onset Alzheimer's disease
  (AD) affects disease progression. The role of peripheral monocytes in Aβ clearance
  from the central nervous system (CNS) is unclear. We use a flow cytometry assay
  to identify Aβ-binding monocytes in blood, validated by confocal microscopy, Western
  blotting, and mass spectrometry. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping and correlation
  with AD biomarkers are studied in 150 participants from the AIBL study. We also
