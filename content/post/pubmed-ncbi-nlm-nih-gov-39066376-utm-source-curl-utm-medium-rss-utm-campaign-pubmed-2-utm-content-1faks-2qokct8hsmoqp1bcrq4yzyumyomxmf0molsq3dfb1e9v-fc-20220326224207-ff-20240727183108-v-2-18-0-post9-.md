description: We recently showed that an adapted SARS-CoV-2 vaccine with wildtype and
  BA.4/BA.5 Omicron subtype epitopes induced a broad short-term immune response in
  hemodialysis patients. Antibodies with protective capacity were boosted significantly
  after a follow-up period of 3 weeks following a fifth vaccine dose. However, data
  on the longevity of the humoral response after bivalent vaccination are lacking
  but urgently needed to make recommendations for further booster vaccinations in
  this patient ...
