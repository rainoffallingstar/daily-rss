description: This Letter presents the most precise measurement to date of the matter-antimatter
  imbalance at midrapidity in Pb-Pb collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon
  pair sqrt[s_{NN}]=5.02 TeV. Using the Statistical Hadronization framework, it is
  possible to obtain the value of the electric charge and baryon chemical potentials,
  μ_{Q}=-0.18±0.90 MeV and μ_{B}=0.71±0.45 MeV, with unprecedented precision. A centrality-differential
  study of the antiparticle-to-particle yield ratios of ...
