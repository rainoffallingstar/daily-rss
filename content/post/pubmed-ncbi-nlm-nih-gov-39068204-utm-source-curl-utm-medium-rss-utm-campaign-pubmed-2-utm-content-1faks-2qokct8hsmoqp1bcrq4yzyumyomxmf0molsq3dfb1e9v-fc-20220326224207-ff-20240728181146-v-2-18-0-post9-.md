description: Ferroptosis has attracted attention throughout the last decade because
  of its tremendous clinical importance. Here, we review the rapidly growing body
  of literature on how inhibition of ferroptosis may be harnessed for the treatment
  of common diseases, and we focus on metabolic and cardiovascular unmet medical needs.
  We introduce four classes of preclinically established ferroptosis inhibitors (ferrostatins)
  such as iron chelators, radical trapping agents that function in the ...
