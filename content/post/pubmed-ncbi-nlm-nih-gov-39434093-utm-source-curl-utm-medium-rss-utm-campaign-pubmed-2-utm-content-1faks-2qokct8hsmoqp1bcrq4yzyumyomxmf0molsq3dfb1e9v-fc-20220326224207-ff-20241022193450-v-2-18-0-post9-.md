description: 'CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptional programs of early terminal granulocytic
  differentiation distinguish sepsis from SIRS due to both higher counts of immature
  granulocytes and elevated expression of early developmental genes in sepsis. The
  sustained expression of PLAC8 in mature granulocytes likely accounts for its selection
  in the whole blood SeptiCyte™ LAB test. Total granulocyte PLAC8 rivals CRP as sepsis
  biomarker. However, infection-specific transcriptional pathways, that differentiate
