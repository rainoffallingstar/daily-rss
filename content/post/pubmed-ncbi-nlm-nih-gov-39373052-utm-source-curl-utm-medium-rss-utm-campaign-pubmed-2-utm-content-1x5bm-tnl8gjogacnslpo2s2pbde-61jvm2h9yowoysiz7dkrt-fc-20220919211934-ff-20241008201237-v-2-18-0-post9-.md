description: Natural products (NPs) are indispensable in drug development, particularly
  in combating infections, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, their
  limited availability poses significant challenges. Template-free de novo biosynthetic
  pathway design provides a strategic solution for NP production, with deep learning
  standing out as a powerful tool in this domain. This review delves into state-of-the-art
  deep learning algorithms in NP biosynthesis pathway design. It provides an ...
