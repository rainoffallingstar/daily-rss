  a new host molecule for fullerenes (C(60) and C(70)). The new host molecule is a
  double N-heterotriangulene-[5]helicene (NTH), consisting of two N-heterotriangulene
  (N-HTA) blades embedded into a hexabenzocoronene-like backbone with helically curved
  topology. Host-guest complexes of [1:1]^(+)˙^(/2+), [1:2]^(+)˙^(/2+), [2:1]^(2+)
  and [2:3]^(2+) stoichiometry and charge state are formed by electrospray ...
