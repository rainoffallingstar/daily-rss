description: A recent hypothesis states that Menière's disease is caused by inappropriate
  expression, i.e. enhanced release of the neurotransmitter calcitonin gene-related
  peptide. Here, we tested this hypothesis by administering rimegepant, a new calcitonin
  gene-related peptide antagonist approved for the acute treatment of migraine and
  for the prevention of episodic migraine, to six patients with both Menière's disease
  and migraine. Two patients received the first dose of 75 mg rimegepant to treat
