description: Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) serology is an important tool for monitoring
  infection and disease burden but there are currently no formal reference reagents
  to harmonize results reporting. Our objective was to develop a panel of candidate
  reference reagents with reactivity against the major outer membrane protein (MOMP)
  and virulence factor (pgp3) antigens. Plasma packs from females (20-40 years old)
  were screened against MOMP and pgp3 antigens and selected positive and negative
  samples pooled ...
