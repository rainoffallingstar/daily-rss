description: Accurate identification of spatial domains is essential in the analysis
  of spatial transcriptomics data in order to elucidate tissue microenvironments and
  biological functions. However, existing methods only perform domain segmentation
  based on local or global spatial relationships between spots, resulting in an underutilization
  of spatial information. To this end, we propose SECE, a deep learning-based method
  that captures both local and global relationships among spots and aggregates ...
