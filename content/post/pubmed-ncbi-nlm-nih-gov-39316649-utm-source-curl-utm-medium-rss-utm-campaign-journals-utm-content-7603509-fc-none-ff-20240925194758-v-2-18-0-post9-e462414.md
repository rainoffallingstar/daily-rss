description: There are few options for patients with relapse/refractory B-cell acute
  lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), thus this is a major area of unmet medical need.
  Here, we reveal that inclusion of a poison exon in RBM39, which could be induced
  both by CDK9 or CDK9 independent CMGC (cyclin-dependent kinases, mitogen-activated
  protein kinases, glycogen synthase kinases, CDC-like kinases) kinase inhibition,
  is recognized by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway for degradation.
  Targeting this ...
