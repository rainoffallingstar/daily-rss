description: Homogeneous, site-specifically conjugated antibodies have shown to result
  in antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) with improved efficacy and tolerability compared
  to stochastically conjugated ADCs. However, precisely controlling the drug-load
  as well as attaching multiple payload moieties on the antibody remains challenging.
  Here, we demonstrate the simple and direct modification of native IgG-antibodies
  at the residue glutamine 295 (Q295) without the need for any protein engineering
