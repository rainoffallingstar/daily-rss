  dose. However, current practice of recording and reporting dose in proton therapy
  must be complemented: the recommended quantity beyond dose was the dose-averaged
  LET in water from primary and secondary protons, normalized to unit density. This
  will facilitate analyses of treatment data on effectiveness beyond dose and between
  centres. No consensus on a single variable RBE model was found. More clinical training
