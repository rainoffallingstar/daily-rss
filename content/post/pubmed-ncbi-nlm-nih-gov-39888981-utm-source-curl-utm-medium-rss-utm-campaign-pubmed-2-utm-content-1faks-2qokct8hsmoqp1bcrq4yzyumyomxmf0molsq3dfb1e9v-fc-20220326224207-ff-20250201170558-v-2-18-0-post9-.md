description: Stem-like T cells are attractive immunotherapeutic targets in patients
  with cancer given their ability to proliferate and differentiate into effector progeny.
  Thus, identifying T cells with enhanced stemness and understanding their developmental
  requirements are of broad clinical and therapeutic interest. Here, we demonstrate
  that during acute infection, the transcriptional regulator inhibitor of DNA binding
  3 (ID3) identifies stem-like T cells that are uniquely adapted to generate precursors
