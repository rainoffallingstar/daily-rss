description: The very first representative of trithia-bridged N-heterotriangulene,
  a triphenylamine with sulfur atoms bridging the ortho-positions, was synthesized
  by a sequence of regioselective sulfenylation with phthalimidesulfenyl chloride
  followed by Lewis acid-catalyzed electrophilic cyclization. X-ray crystallography
  revealed a saddle-shaped geometry of the polycyclic scaffold. UV/Vis absorption
  spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry were used to characterize the optoelectronic
  properties. The ...
