description: Digital light processing (DLP) is a 3D printing technology offering high
  resolution and speed. Printable materials are commonly based on multifunctional
  monomers, resulting in the formation of thermosets that usually cannot be reprocessed
  or recycled. Some efforts are made in DLP 3D printing of thermoplastic materials.
  However, these materials exhibit limited and poor mechanical properties. Here, a
  new strategy is presented for DLP 3D printing of thermoplastics based on a sequential
