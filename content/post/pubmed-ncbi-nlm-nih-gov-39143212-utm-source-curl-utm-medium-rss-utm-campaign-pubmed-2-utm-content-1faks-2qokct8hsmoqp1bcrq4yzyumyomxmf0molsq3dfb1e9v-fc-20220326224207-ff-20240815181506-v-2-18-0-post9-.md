description: Many powerful tests of the standard model of particle physics and searches
  for new physics with precision atomic spectroscopy are hindered by our lack of knowledge
  of nuclear properties. Ideally, these properties may be derived from precise measurements
  of the most sensitive and theoretically best-understood observables, often found
  in hydrogen-like systems. Although these measurements are abundant for the electric
  properties of nuclei, they are scarce for the magnetic properties, and ...
