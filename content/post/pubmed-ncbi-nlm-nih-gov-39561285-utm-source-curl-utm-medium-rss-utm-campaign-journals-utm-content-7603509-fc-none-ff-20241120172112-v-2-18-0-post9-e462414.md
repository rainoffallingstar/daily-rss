description: CD47 is overexpressed on the surface of many types of cancer cells, including
  T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells. In this study, we have developed
  a diphtheria toxin-based bivalent anti-human CD47 immunotoxin (bi-CD47-IT) for the
  targeted therapy of CD47+ cancers using a unique diphtheria toxin-resistant yeast
  Pichia pastoris expression system. Bi-CD47-IT demonstrated compelling in vivo efficacy
  in multiple T-ALL cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived ...
