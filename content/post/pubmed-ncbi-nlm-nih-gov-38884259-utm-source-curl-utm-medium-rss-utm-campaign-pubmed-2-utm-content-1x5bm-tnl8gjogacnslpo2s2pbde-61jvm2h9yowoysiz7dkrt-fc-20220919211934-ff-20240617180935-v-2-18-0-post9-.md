description: The intricacies of the human genome, manifested as a complex network
  of genes, transcend conventional representations in text or numerical matrices.
  The intricate gene-to-gene relationships inherent in this complexity find a more
  suitable depiction in graph structures. In the pursuit of predicting gene expression,
  an endeavor shared by predecessors like the L1000 and Enformer methods, we introduce
  a novel spatial graph-neural network (GNN) approach. This innovative strategy incorporates
