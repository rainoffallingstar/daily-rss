description: Antibodies to β2-glycoprotein I (β2GPI) cause thrombosis in antiphospholipid
  syndrome, however the role of β2GPI in coagulation in vivo is not understood. To
  address this issue, we developed β2GPI-deficient mice (Apoh-/-) by deleting exon
  2 and 3 of Apoh using CRISPR/Cas9 and compared the development of thrombosis in
  wild-type (WT) and Apoh-/- mice using rose bengal and FeCl3-induced carotid thrombosis,
  laser-induced cremaster arteriolar injury, and inferior vena cava (IVC) stasis models.
