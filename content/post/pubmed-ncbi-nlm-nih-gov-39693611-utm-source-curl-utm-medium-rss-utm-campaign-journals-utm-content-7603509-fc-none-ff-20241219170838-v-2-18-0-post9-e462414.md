description: We previously demonstrated that reduced intrinsic electron transport
  chain (ETC) activity predicts and promotes sensitivity to the BCL-2 antagonist,
  venetoclax (Ven) in multiple myeloma (MM). Heme, an iron-containing prosthetic group,
  and metabolite is fundamental to maintaining ETC activity. Interrogation of the
  CD2 subgroup of MM from the CoMMpass trial (NCT01454297), which can be used as a
  proxy for Ven-sensitive MM (VS MM), shows reduced expression of the conserved heme
  biosynthesis ...
