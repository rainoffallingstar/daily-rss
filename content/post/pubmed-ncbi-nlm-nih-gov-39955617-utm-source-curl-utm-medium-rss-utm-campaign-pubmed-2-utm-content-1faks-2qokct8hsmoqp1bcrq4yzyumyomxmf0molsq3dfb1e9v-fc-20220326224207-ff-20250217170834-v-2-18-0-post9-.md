description: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe neuromuscular disease, leading
  to progressive muscle weakness and potentially early mortality if untreated. Onasemnogene
  abeparvovec is a recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (rAAV9)-based gene
  therapy that has demonstrated improvements in survival and motor function for SMA
