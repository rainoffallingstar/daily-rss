description: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central
  nervous system. Inflammation is gradually compartmentalized and restricted to specific
  tissue niches such as the lesion rim. However, the precise cell type composition
  of such niches, their interactions and changes between chronic active and inactive
  stages are incompletely understood. We used single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomics
  from subcortical MS and corresponding control tissues to map cell types and ...
