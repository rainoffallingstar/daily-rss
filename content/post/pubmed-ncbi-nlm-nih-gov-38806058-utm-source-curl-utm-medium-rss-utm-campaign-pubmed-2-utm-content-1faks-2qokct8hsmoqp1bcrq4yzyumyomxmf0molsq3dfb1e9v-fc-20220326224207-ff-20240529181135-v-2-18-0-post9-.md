description: Aspartate is crucial for nucleotide synthesis, ammonia detoxification,
  and maintaining redox balance via the malate-aspartate-shuttle (MAS). To disentangle
  these multiple roles of aspartate metabolism, tools are required that measure aspartate
  concentrations in real time and in live cells. We introduce AspSnFR, a genetically
  encoded green fluorescent biosensor for intracellular aspartate, engineered through
  displaying and screening biosensor libraries on mammalian cells. In live cells,
