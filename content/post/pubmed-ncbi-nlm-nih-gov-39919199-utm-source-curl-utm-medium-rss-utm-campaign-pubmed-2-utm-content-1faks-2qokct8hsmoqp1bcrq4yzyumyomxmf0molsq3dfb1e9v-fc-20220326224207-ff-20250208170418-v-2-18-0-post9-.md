description: The bone marrow microenvironment plays a crucial role in the development
  of multiple myeloma. As the disease progresses, malignant myeloma cells can evolve
  to survive outside the bone marrow. However, the processes underlying bone marrow
  independence and their consequences for immune control remain poorly understood.
  Here, we conducted single-cell and spatial multiomics analyses of bone marrow-confined
  intramedullary disease and paired breakout lesions that disrupt the cortical bone.
