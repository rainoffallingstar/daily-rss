description: The areoles and spines of cacti can be used to desorb ions of ionic liquids
  (ILs) by the mere action of an electric field into the atmospheric pressure (AP)
  interface of a mass spectrometer. The small cactus species Opuntia microdasys bears
  numerous very fine hairs on its areoles and tiny sharp spines that appeared suited
  to serve as needle electrodes sharp enough for field desorption of ions to occur.
  In fact, positive and negative ions of four ILs could be desorbed by a process analogous
