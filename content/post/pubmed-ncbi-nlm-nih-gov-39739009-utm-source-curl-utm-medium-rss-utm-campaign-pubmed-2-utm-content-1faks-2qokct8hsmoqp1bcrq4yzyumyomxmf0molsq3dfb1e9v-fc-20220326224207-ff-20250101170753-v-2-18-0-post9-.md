description: Cyclic di-adenylate monophosphate (cyclic di-AMP) is an important second
  messenger in microorganisms. Cyclic di-AMP regulates bacterial cell volume and turgor
  via control of potassium and compatible solute transport but is also involved in
  many other processes, including the activation of the metazoan innate immune response
