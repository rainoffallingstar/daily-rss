description: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial disease with both genetic
  and environmental factors contributing to its etiology. Previous evidence has implicated
  disturbed insulin signaling as a key mechanism that plays a role in both neurodegenerative
  diseases such as AD and comorbid somatic diseases such as diabetes mellitus type
  2 (DM2). In this study, we analysed available genome-wide association studies (GWASs)
  of AD and somatic insulin-related diseases and conditions (SID), i.e., ...
