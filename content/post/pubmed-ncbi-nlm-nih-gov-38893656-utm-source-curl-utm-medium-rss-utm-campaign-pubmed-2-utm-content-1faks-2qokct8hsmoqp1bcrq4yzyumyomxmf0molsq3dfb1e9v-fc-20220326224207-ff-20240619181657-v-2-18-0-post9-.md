description: The clinical use of photon-counting CT (PCCT) allows for the generation
  of virtual non-contrast (VNC) series from contrast-enhanced images. In routine clinical
  practice, specific issues such as ruling out acute bleeding require non-contrast
  images. The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of PCCT-derived VNC reconstructions
  in abdominal imaging. PCCT scans of 17 patients including early arterial, portal
  venous and native sequences were enrolled. VNC reconstructions have been calculated.
