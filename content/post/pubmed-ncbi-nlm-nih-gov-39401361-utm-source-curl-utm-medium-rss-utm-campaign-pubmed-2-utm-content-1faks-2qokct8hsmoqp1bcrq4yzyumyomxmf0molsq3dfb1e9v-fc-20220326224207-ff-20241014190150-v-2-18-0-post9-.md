description: Although it is well established that the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein
  binds to the host cell ACE2 receptor to initiate infection, far less is known about
  the tissue tropism and host cell susceptibility to the virus. Differential expression
  across different cell types of heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans, with variably
  sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and their synergistic interactions with host
  and viral N-glycans may contribute to tissue tropism and host cell susceptibility.
