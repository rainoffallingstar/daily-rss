description: Cancer diagnosis and therapy cause stress to the body. Preclinical studies
  have shown that stress hormones can stimulate tumor progression and metastasis by
  interacting with β-adrenergic receptors, and that β-blockers can inhibit those processes.
  We assessed if β-blocker use was associated with survival in a nationwide cohort
  of women with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). We identified all women aged ≥40
  years who underwent EOC surgery in 2004-2018 in Norway through the Cancer Registry
