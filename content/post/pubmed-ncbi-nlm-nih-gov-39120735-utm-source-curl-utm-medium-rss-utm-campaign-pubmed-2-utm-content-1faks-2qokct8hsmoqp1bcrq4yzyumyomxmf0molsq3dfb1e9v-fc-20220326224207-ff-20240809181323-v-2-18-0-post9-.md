description: Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) includes generative models,
  multimodal foundation models, and federated learning, which enable a wide spectrum
  of novel exciting applications and scenarios for cardiac image analysis and cardiovascular
  interventions. The disruptive nature of these novel technologies enables concurrent
  text and image analysis by so-called vision-language transformer models. They not
  only allow for automatic derivation of image reports, synthesis of novel ...
