description: Customizable manufacturing of ex vivo cell engineering is driven by the
  need for innovations in the biomedical field and holds substantial potential for
  addressing current therapeutic challenges; but it is still only in its infancy.
  Micro- and nanoscale-engineered materials are increasingly used to control core
  cell-level functions in cellular engineering. By reprogramming or redirecting targeted
  cells for extremely precise functions, these advanced materials offer new possibilities.
