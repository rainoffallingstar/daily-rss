description: Nanoporous Pt films fabricated by oblique angle deposition hold potential
  as electrocatalysts in various energy-related fields owing to their high surface
  area, structural stability, and adequate conductivity. In this study, we investigated
  the morphology, porosity, and electrical conductivity of nanoporous Pt thin films
  and systematically studied their interrelationships. Specifically, we revealed an
