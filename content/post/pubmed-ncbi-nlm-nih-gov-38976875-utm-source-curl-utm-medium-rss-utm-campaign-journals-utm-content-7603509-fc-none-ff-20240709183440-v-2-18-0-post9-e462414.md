description: There is an urgent and unmet clinical need to develop non-pharmacological
  interventions for chronic pain management due to the critical side effects of opioids.
  Low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound is an emerging non-invasive neuromodulation
  technology with high spatial specificity and deep brain penetration. Here, we developed
  a tightly-focused 128-element ultrasound transducer to specifically target small
  mouse brains, employing dynamic focus steering. We demonstrate that ...
