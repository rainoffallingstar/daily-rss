description: Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is a ubiquitous lipid species in higher
  eukaryotes. Here, we synthesized a multifunctionalized PE derivative (1) designed
  to identify PE-binding proteins in intact cells through photo-crosslinking and subsequent
  isolation and proteomic analysis of the PE-protein conjugates. We show that the
  tool is also useful for tracking PE translocation to mitochondria after uncaging.
  A trifunctional phosphatidic acid derivative was rapidly metabolized and is of more
