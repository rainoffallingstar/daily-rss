description: 'CONCLUSION: This study provides novel insight into factors associated
  with sICH in patients undergoing MT for DMVO, emphasizing the importance of age,
  distal occlusion site, prior use of antiplatelet drugs, lower ASPECTS, higher preoperative
  blood glucose level, and procedural factors such as the number of passes and successful
  recanalization. Pending confirmation, consideration of these factors may improve
  personalized treatment ...'
