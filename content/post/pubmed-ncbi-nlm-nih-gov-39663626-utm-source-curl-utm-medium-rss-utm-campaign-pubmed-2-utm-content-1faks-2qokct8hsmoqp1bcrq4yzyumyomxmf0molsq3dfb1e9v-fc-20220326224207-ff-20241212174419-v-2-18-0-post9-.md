CONCLUSIONS: A potential association between sleep quality and glycaemic variability exists. However, associations with other sleep metrics remain elusive, with no discernible association between sleep duration and glycaemic variability in type 1 diabetes. Despite advancements in continuous glucose monitoring and ambulatory sleep monitoring, standardised sleep assessment methodologies are lacking in real-world studies.
