description: Cas12a is a next-generation gene editing tool that enables multiplexed
  gene targeting. Here, we present a mouse model that constitutively expresses enhanced
  Acidaminococcus sp. Cas12a (enAsCas12a) linked to an mCherry fluorescent reporter.
  We demonstrate efficient single and multiplexed gene editing in vitro, using primary
  and transformed cells from enAsCas12a mice. We further demonstrate successful in
  vivo gene editing, using normal and cancer-prone enAsCas12a stem cells to reconstitute
