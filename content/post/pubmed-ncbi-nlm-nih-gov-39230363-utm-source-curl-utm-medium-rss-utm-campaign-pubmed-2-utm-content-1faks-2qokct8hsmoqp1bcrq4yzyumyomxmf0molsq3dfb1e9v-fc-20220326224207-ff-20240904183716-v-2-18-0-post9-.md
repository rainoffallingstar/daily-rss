description: Here we present measurements of dissociative and non-dissociative cross-sections
  for the electron impact of the CF4 molecule. The present experiments are based on
  a Recoil Ion Momentum Spectrometer (RIMS), a standard gas mixing setup for CF4,
  and a reference gas. The measurements were carried out at several electron energies
  up to 1 keV, covering the energy range of previous experiments. We apply the relative
  flow technique (RFT) to convert the relative cross-sections measured by the RIMS
