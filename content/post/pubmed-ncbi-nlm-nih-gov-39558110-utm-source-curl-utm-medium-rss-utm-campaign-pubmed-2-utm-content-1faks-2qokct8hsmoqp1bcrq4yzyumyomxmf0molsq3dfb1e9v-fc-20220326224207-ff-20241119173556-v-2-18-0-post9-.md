description: Proteome profiling of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens
  has gained traction for the analysis of cancer tissue for the discovery of molecular
  biomarkers. However, reports so far focused on single cancer entities, comprised
  relatively few cases and did not assess the long-term performance of experimental
  workflows. In this study, we analyze 1220 tumors from six cancer entities processed
  over the course of three years. Key findings include the need for a new normalization
