description: Blood flow velocity in the cerebral perforating arteries can be quantified
  in a two-dimensional plane with phase contrast magnetic imaging (2D PC-MRI). The
  velocity pulsatility index (PI) can inform on the stiffness of these perforating
  arteries, which is related to several cerebrovascular diseases. Currently, there
  is no open-source analysis tool for 2D PC-MRI data from these small vessels, impeding
  the usage of these measurements. In this study we present the Small vessEL MArker
