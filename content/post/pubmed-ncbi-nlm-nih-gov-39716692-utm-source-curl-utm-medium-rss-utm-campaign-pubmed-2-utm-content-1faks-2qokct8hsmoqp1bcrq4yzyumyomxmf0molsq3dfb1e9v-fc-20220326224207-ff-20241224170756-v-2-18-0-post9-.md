description: Repeat HLA mismatches (RMM) have been historically associated with an
  increased risk of graft loss after repeat kidney transplantation, in particular
  HLA-DR RMM in sensitized recipients. As routine use of sensitive assays can at present
  prevent the transplantation of RMM in hosts with donor-specific antibodies, we hypothesized
  that RMM would no longer be associated with graft loss. We performed a registry
