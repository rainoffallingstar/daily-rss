description: Rondaptivan pegol (previously BT200) is a PEGylated RNA aptamer that
  binds to the A1 domain of VWF. Recent clinical trials demonstrated that BT200 significantly
  increased plasma VWF-FVIII levels by attenuating VWF clearance. The biological mechanism(s)
  through which BT200 attenuates in vivo clearance of VWF have not been defined. We
  hypothesized that BT200 interaction with the VWF-A1 domain may increase plasma VWF
  levels by attenuating macrophage-mediated clearance. We observed that full ...
