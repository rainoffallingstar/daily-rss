description: Ex vivo expansion of human CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells
  remains a challenge due to rapid differentiation after detachment from the bone
  marrow niche. In this study, we assessed the capacity of an inducible fusion protein
  to enable sustained ex vivo proliferation of hematopoietic precursors and their
  capacity to differentiate into functional phagocytes. We fused the coding sequences
  of an FK506-Binding Protein 12 (FKBP12)-derived destabilization domain (DD) to ...
