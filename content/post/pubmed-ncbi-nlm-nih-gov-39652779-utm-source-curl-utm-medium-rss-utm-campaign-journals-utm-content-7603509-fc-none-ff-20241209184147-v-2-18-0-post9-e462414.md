description: Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T and NK cell therapies
  have revolutionized the treatment of B cell malignancies, but challenges including
  CD19 antigen loss greatly hinder their full therapeutic potential. Here we demonstrated
  that co-treatment with anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody enhances antitumor activity
  of anti-CD19 CAR-T and -NK cells. Even though the treated antibody interferes with
  CD19 antigen binding of CAR, it significantly induces rapid detachment of anti-CD19
