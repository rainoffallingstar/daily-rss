description: Epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome analyses of postmortem brains
  have revealed initial molecular insights into cocaine use disorder (CUD). However,
  the inter-relationship between these omics and the contribution of individual cell
  types remains largely unknown. We present an in-depth analysis of molecular changes
  in the ventral striatum in CUD at multi-omics and single-cell resolution. Integrative
  multi-omics analyses of microRNA sequencing (microRNA-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq),
