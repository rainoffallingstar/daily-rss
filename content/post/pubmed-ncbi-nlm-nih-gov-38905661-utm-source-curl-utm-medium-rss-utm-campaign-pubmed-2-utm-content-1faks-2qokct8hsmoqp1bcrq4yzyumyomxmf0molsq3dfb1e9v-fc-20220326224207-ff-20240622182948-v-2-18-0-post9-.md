description: The combination of optical tweezer arrays with strong interactions-via
  dipole exchange of molecules and Van der Waals interactions of Rydberg atoms-has
  opened the door for the exploration of a wide variety of quantum spin models. A
  next significant step will be the combination of such settings with mobile dopants.
  This will enable one to simulate the physics believed to underlie many strongly
  correlated quantum materials. Here, we propose an experimental scheme to realize
  bosonic t-J models ...
