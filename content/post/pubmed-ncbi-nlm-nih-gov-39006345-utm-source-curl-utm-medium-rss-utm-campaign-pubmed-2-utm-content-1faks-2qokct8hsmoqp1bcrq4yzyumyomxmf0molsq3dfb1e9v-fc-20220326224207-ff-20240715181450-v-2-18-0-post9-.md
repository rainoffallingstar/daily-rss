description: In January 2021, Germany commenced surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants
  under the Corona Surveillance Act, which ceased in July 2023. The objective was
  to bolster pandemic control, as specific alterations in amino acids, particularly
  within the spike protein, were linked to heightened transmission and decreased vaccine
  effectiveness. Consequently, our team conducted whole genome sequencing using the
  commercially accessible ARTIC protocol on Illumina's NextSeq500 platform and MiSeq
  for ...
