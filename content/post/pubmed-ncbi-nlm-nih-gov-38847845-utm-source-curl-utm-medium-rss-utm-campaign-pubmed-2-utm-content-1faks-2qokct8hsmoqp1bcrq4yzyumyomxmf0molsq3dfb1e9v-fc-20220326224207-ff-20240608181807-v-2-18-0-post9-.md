description: The non-WNT/non-SHH (Grp3/Grp4) medulloblastomas (MBs) include eight
  second-generation subgroups (SGS; I-VIII) each with distinct molecular and clinical
  characteristics. Recently, we also identified two prognostically relevant transcriptome
  subtypes within each SGS MB, which are associated with unique gene expression signatures
  and signaling pathways. These prognostic subsets may be in connection to the intra-tumoral
  cell landscape that underlies SGS MB clinical-molecular diversity. Here, ...
