description: Acute leukemia is characterized by the swift proliferation of immature
  white blood cells (WBC) in the blood and bone marrow. It is categorized into acute
  lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), depending on whether
  the cell-line origin is lymphoid or myeloid, respectively. Deep learning (DL) and
  artificial intelligence (AI) are revolutionizing medical sciences by assisting clinicians
  with rapid illness identification, reducing workload, and enhancing diagnostic ...
