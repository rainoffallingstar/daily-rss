description: Proteases are key enzymes in viral replication, and interfering with
  these targets is the basis for therapeutic interventions. We previously introduced
  a hypothesis about conformational selection in the protease of dengue virus and
  related flaviviruses, based on conformational plasticity noted in X-ray structures.
  The present work presents the first functional evidence for alternate recognition
  by the dengue protease, in a mechanism based primarily on conformational selection
