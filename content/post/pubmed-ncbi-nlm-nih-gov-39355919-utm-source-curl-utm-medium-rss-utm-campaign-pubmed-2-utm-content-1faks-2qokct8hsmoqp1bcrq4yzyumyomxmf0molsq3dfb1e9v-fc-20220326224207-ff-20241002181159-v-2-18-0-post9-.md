description: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) represents the most prevalent aggressive
  B-cell lymphoma. The group is heterogeneous and the outcome is variable. A variety
  of approaches have been employed with the objective of improving the stratification
  of DLBCL patients according to their prognosis, based on the cell of origin. Recently,
  distinct genetic subtypes of DLBCL have been identified. Given the importance of
  cell migration in immune cells, the objective of this study was to ascertain ...
