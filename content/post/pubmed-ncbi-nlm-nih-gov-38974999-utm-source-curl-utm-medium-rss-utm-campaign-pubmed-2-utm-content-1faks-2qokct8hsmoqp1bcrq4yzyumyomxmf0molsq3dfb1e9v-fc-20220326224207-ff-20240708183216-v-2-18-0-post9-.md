description: Circular RNA (circRNA) molecules have critical functions during brain
  development and in brain-related disorders. Here, we identified and validated a
  circRNA, circHTT(2,3,4,5,6), stemming from the Huntington's disease (HD) gene locus
  that is most abundant in the central nervous system (CNS). We uncovered its evolutionary
  conservation in diverse mammalian species, and a correlation between circHTT(2,3,4,5,6)
  levels and the length of the CAG-repeat tract in exon-1 of HTT in human and mouse
