description: The lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) plays a crucial
  role in both T-cell development and activation. Dysregulation of LCK signaling has
  been demonstrated to drive the oncogenesis of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
  (T-ALL), thus providing a therapeutic target for leukemia treatment. In this study,
  we introduced a sophisticated virtual screening strategy combined with biological
  evaluations to discover potent LCK inhibitors. Our initial approach involved utilizing
