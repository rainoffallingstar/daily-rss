description: ASCT2 is an obligate exchanger of neutral amino acids, contributing to
  cellular amino acid homeostasis. ASCT2 belongs to the same family (SLC1) as Excitatory
  Amino Acid Transporters (EAATs) that concentrate glutamate in the cytosol. The mechanism
  that makes ASCT2 an exchanger rather than a concentrator remains enigmatic. Here,
  we employ cryo-electron microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate
  the structural basis of the exchange mechanism of ASCT2. We establish that ASCT2
