description: Thrombocytopenic patients require platelet transfusion to prevent and
  stop hemorrhage. Cold storage of platelets results in complex molecular lesions
  including changes in membrane microdomains that are recognized by host macrophages
  and hepatocyte counter-receptors, resulting in phagocytosis and clearance upon transfusion.
  For this reason, platelets are stored at room temperature, a method that confers
  increased risk of bacterial contamination. By applying signaling analysis as well
