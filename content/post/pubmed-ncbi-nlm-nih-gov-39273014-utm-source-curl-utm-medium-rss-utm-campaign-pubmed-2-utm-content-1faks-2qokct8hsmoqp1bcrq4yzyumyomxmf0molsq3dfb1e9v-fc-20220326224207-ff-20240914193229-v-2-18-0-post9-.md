description: Overcoming temozolomide (TMZ)-resistance is a major challenge in glioblastoma
  therapy. Therefore, identifying the key molecular player in chemo-resistance becomes
  urgent. We previously reported the downregulation of PDCD10 in primary glioblastoma
  patients and its tumor suppressor-like function in glioblastoma cells. Here, we
  demonstrate that the loss of PDCD10 causes a significant TMZ-resistance during treatment
  and promotes a rapid regrowth of tumor cells after treatment. PDCD10 ...
