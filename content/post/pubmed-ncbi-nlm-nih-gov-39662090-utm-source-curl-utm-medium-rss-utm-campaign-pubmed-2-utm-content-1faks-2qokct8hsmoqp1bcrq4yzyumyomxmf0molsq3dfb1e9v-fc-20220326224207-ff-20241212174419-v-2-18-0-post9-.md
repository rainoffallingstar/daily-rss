description: Mast cells are regarded as effectors in immune defense against parasites
  and venoms and play an essential role in the pathology of allergic diseases. More
  recently, mast cells have been shown to receive stimuli derived from type 2 immunity,
  tissue damage, stress, and inflammation. Mast cells then rapidly convert these diverse
  signals into appropriate, organ-specific protective reflexes that can limit inflammation
  or reduce tissue damage. In this review, we consider functions of mast cells ...
