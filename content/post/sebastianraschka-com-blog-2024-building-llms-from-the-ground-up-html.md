description: This tutorial is aimed at coders interested in understanding the building
  blocks of large language models (LLMs), how LLMs work, and how to code them from
  the ground up in PyTorch. We will kick off this tutorial with an introduction to
  LLMs, recent milestones, and their use cases. Then, we will code a small GPT-like
  LLM, including its data input pipeline, core architecture components, and pretraining
  code ourselves. After understanding how everything fits together and how to pretrain
  an LLM, we will learn how to load pretrained weights and finetune LLMs using open-source
