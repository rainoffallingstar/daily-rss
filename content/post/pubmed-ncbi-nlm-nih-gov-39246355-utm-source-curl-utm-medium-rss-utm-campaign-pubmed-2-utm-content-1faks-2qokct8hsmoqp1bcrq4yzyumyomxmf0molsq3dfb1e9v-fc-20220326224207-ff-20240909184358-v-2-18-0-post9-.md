description: The stepwise, one-pot synthesis of heterobimetallic carbene gold(i) platinum(ii)
  complexes from readily available starting materials is presented. The protecting
  group free methodology is based on the graduated nucleophilicities of aliphatic
  and aromatic amines as linkers between both metal centers. This enables the selective,
  sequential installation of the metal fragments. In addition, the obtained complexes
  were tested as potential anticancer agents and directly compared to their ...
