description: This article introduces a causal discovery method to learn nonlinear
  relationships in a directed acyclic graph with correlated Gaussian errors due to
  confounding. First, we derive model identifiability under the sublinear growth assumption.
  Then, we propose a novel method, named the Deconfounded Functional Structure Estimation
  (DeFuSE), consisting of a deconfounding adjustment to remove the confounding effects
  and a sequential procedure to estimate the causal order of variables. We ...
