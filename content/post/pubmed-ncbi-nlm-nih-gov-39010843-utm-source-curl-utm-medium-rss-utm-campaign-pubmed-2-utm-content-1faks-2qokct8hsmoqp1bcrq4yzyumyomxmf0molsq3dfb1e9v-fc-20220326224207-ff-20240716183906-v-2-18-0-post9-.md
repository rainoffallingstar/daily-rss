description: Parental genes can influence the phenotype of their offspring through
  genomic-epigenomic interactions even without the direct inheritance of specific
  parental genotypes. Maternal genetic variations can affect the ovarian and intrauterine
  environments and potentially alter lactation behaviors, impacting offspring nutrition
  and health outcomes independently of the fetal genome. Similarly, paternal genetic
  changes can affect the endocrine system and vascular functions in the testes, ...
