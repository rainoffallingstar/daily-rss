description: High-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL), the subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma,
  to be relapsed or refractory in patients after initial therapy or salvage chemotherapy.
  Dual dysregulation of MYC and BCL2 is one of the important pathogenic mechanisms.
  Thus, combined targeting of MYC and BCL2 appears to be a promising strategy. Dihydroorotate
  dehydrogenase (DHODH) is the fourth rate-limiting enzyme for the de novo biosynthesis
  of pyrimidine. It has been shown to be a potential therapeutic target ...
