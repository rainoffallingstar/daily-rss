description: Current treatment approaches cannot exactly regenerate cartilage tissue.
  Regarding some problems encountered with cell therapy, exosomes are advantageous
  because of their "cell-free" nature. This study examines the relationship between
  IL-10 and TGF-β and Canonical Wnt/β-catenin signal pathways in human adipose tissue-derived
  MSCs exosomes (hAT-MSCs-Exos) after in vitro chondrogenic differentiation. Human
  adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAT-MSCs) and, as a control group,
