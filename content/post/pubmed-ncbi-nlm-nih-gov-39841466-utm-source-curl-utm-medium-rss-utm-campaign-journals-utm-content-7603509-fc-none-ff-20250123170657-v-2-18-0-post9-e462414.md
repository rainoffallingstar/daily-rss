description: Previous studies have reported that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
  shows a de novo chromatin activation pattern as compared to normal B cells. Here,
  we explored whether the level of chromatin activation is related to the clinical
  behavior of CLL. We identified that in some regulatory regions, increased de novo
  chromatin activation is linked to clinical progression whereas, in other regions,
  it is associated with an indolent course. We next developed two prognostic scores
  for progressive ...
