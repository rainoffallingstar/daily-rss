description: ZUMA-12 is a multicenter phase 2 study that evaluated axicabtagene ciloleucel
  (axi-cel), an autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy,
  as part of first-line treatment in patients with high-risk large B-cell lymphoma
  (LBCL). In the primary efficacy analysis (n=37; 15.9 months median follow-up), axi-cel
  demonstrated a high rate of complete responses (CR; 78%) and a safety profile consistent
  with prior experience. Here, we assessed updated outcomes from ZUMA-12 in ...
