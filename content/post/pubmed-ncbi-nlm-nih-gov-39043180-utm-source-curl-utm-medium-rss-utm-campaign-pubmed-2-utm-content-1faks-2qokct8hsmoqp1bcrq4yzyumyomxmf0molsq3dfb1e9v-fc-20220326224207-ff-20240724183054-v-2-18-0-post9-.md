description: The medical burden of stroke extends beyond the brain injury itself and
  is largely determined by chronic comorbidities that develop secondarily. We hypothesized
  that these comorbidities might share a common immunological cause, yet chronic effects
  post-stroke on systemic immunity are underexplored. Here, we identify myeloid innate
  immune memory as a cause of remote organ dysfunction after stroke. Single-cell sequencing
  revealed persistent pro-inflammatory changes in monocytes/macrophages ...
