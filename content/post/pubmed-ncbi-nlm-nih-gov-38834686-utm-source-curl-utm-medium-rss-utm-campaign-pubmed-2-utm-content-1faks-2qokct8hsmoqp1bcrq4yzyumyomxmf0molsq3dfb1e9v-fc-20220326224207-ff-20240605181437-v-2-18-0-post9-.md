description: Mg/Ca is an independent proxy in paleoceanography to reconstruct past
  seawater temperature. Femtosecond Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass
  Spectrometry (fs-LA-ICP-MS) was employed to determine the Mg/Ca composition of tests
  (shells) of the planktic foraminifer species Globigerinoides ruber albus (white
  chromotype) and G. ruber ruber (red/pink chromotype) sampled alive from the temperate
  to subtropical eastern North Atlantic with the research sailing yacht Eugen Seibold.
