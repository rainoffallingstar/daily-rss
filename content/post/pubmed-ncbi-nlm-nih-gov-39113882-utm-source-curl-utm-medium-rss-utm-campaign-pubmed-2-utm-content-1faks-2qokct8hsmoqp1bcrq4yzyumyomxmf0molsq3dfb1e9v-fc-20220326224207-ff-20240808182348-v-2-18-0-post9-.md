description: Endothelial dysfunction may contribute to pathogenesis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,
  but mechanism underlying endothelial dysfunction in the setting of catecholamine
  excess has not been clarified. The study reports that D1/D5 dopamine receptor signaling
  and small conductance calcium-activated potassium channels contribute to high concentration
  catecholamine induced endothelial cell dysfunction. For mimicking catecholamine
  excess, 100 μM epinephrine (Epi) was used to treat human ...
