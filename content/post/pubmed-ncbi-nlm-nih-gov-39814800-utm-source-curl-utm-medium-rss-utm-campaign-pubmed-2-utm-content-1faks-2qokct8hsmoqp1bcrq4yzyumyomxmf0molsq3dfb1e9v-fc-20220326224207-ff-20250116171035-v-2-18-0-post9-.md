description: Complex experimental protocols often require multi-modal data acquisition
  with precisely aligned timing, as well as state- and behavior-dependent interventions.
  Tailored solutions are mostly restricted to individual experimental setups and lack
  flexibility and interoperability. We present an open-source, Linux-based integrated
  software solution, called 'Syntalos', for simultaneous acquisition and synchronization
  of data from an arbitrary number of sources, including ...
