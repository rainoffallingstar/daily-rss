description: 'This study aimed to determine the through-focus performance and the
  effect of misalignment on the optical quality of different aspheric monofocal intraocular
  lenses (IOLs). To this end, optical quality was assessed in three IOL models with
  different optic surfaces: standard aberration neutral model and two spherical aberration
  (SA) correcting, one of which utilizes higher-order aspheric terms. The optical
  quality was measured by means of the modulation transfer function at 3- and 4.5-mm
