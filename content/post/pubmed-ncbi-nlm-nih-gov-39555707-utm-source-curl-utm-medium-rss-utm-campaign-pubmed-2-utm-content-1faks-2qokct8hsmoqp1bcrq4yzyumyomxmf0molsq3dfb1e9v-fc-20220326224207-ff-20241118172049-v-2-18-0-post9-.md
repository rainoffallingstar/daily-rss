description: Iron is an essential element for physiological cellular processes, but
  is toxic in excess. Iron overload diseases are commonly associated with low bone
  mass. Increased bone resorption by osteoclasts as well as decreased bone formation
  by osteoblasts have been implicated in bone loss under iron overload conditions.
  However, the exact contribution of individual cell types has not yet been formally
  tested. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of osteoclast precursors
