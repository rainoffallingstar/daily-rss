description: 'CONCLUSION: The GNNs predictive model and responseScore constructed
  in this study can reflect the immunotherapy response and prognosis of bladder cancer
  patients. ResponseScore can also reflect features such as tumor microenvironment,
  antitumor immunity, and natural killer cell function status in bladder cancer. PSMB9
  was identified as a significant gene for prognosis. High expression of PSMB9 can
  inhibit bladder cancer cell migration and proliferation while increasing cell ...'
