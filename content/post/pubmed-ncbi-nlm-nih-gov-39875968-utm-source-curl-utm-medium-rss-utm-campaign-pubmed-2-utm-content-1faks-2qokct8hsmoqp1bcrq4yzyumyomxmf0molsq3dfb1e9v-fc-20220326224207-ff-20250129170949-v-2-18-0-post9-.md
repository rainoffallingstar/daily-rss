description: 'CONCLUSION: We discovered that the hepatic vascular niche acts as a
  delicate sensor to even short-term nutritional alterations during the development
  of MASLD/MASH. The dynamic adaptations to the metabolic challenges of developing
  MASLD/MASH caused an early shift from the normal hepatic vascular niche to a pre-metastatic
  vascular niche that promoted hepatic melanoma metastasis in the context of cell-autonomous
  and acquired melanoma cell features. Altogether, our findings provide a ...'
