description: Numerous variables that regulate the metabolism of Sertoli cells and
  sperm have been identified, one of which is sex steroid hormones. These hormones
  play a vital role in maintaining energy homeostasis, influencing the overall metabolic
  balance of the human body. The proper functioning of the reproductive system is
  closely linked to energy status, as the reproductive axis responds to metabolic
  signals. The aim of this study was to investigate the gene expression patterns of
