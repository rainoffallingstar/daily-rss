description: This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance of breast
  mass detection on monoenergetic image data at 40 keV (MonoE40) and on iodine maps
  (IM) compared with conventional image data (CI). In this prospective single-center
  case-control study, 50 breast cancer patients were examined using contrast-enhanced
  dual-layer spectral CT. For qualitative and quantitative comparison of MonoE40 and
  IM with CI image data, four blinded, independent readers assessed 300 randomized
  single slices ...
