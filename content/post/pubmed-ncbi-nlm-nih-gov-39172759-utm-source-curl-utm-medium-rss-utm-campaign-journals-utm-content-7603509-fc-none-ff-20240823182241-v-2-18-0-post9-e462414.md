description: Extramedullary disease (EMD) is a high-risk feature of multiple myeloma
  (MM) and remains a poor prognostic factor even in the era of novel immunotherapies.
  Here we applied spatial transcriptomics (tomo-seq [n=2] and 10X Visium [n=12]),
  and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq [n=3]) to a set of 14 EMD biopsies to dissect
  the three-dimensional architecture of tumor cells and their microenvironment. Overall,
  the infiltrating immune and stromal cells showed both intra- and inter-patient ...
