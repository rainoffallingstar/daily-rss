description: Mutations in the TP53 gene, particularly multihit alterations, have been
  associated with unfavorable clinical features and prognosis in patients diagnosed
  with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Despite this, the role of TP53 gene aberrations
  in MDS with isolated deletion of chromosome 5 [MDS-del(5q)] remains unclear. This
  study aimed to assess the impact of TP53 gene mutations and their allelic state
  in patients with MDS-del(5q). To that end, a comprehensive analysis of TP53 ...
