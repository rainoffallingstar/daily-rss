  dumbbell-shaped guard cells (GCs) are flanked by two lateral subsidiary cells (SCs).
  This innovative form enables rapid opening and closing kinetics and efficient plant-atmosphere
  gas exchange. The mobile bHLH transcription factor MUTE is required for SC formation
  in grasses. Yet, if and how MUTE also regulates GC development and if MUTE mobility
  is required for SC recruitment is unclear. Here, we transgenically impaired ...
