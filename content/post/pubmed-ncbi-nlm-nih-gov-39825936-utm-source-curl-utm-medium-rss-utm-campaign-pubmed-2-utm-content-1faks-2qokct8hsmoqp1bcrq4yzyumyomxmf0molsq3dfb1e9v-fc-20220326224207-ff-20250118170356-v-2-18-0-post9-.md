description: While impaired response inhibition has been reported in attention-deficit/hyperactivity
  disorder (ADHD), findings in disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs) have been inconsistent,
  probably due to unaccounted effects of co-occurring ADHD in DBD. This study investigated
  the associations of behavioral and neural correlates of response inhibition with
  DBD and ADHD symptom severity, covarying for each other in a dimensional approach.
  Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were available for ...
