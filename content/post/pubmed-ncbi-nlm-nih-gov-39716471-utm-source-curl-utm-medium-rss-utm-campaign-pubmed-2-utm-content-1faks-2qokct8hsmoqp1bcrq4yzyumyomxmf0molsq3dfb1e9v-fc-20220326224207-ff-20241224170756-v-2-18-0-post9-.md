description: The biology of cancer is characterized by an intricate interplay of cells
  originating not only from the tumor mass, but also its surrounding environment.
  Different microbial species have been suggested to be enriched in tumors and the
  impacts of these on tumor phenotypes is subject to intensive investigation. For
  these efforts, model systems that accurately reflect human-microbe interactions
  are rapidly gaining importance. Here we present a guide for selecting a suitable
