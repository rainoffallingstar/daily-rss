description: Idecabtagene vicleucel (Ide-cel) has demonstrated excellent efficacy
  and durable responses in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM).
  However, the outcomes with ide-cel in patients with extramedullary disease (EMD)
  remain incompletely characterized. We included patients with RRMM treated with ide-cel
  between May 2021 and April 2023 across 11 US academic institutions. Visceral or
  soft tissue lesions non-contiguous from bone was classified as EMD. Time-to-event
