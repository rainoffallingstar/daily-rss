description: The prevailing but not undisputed amyloid cascade hypothesis places the
  β-site of APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) center stage in Alzheimer's Disease pathogenesis.
  Here, we investigated functional properties of BACE1 with novel tag- and antibody-free
  labeling tools, which are conjugates of the BACE1-inhibitor IV (also referred to
  as C3) linked to different impermeable Alexa Fluor dyes. We show that these fluorescent
  small molecules bind specifically to BACE1, with a 1:1 labeling stoichiometry ...
