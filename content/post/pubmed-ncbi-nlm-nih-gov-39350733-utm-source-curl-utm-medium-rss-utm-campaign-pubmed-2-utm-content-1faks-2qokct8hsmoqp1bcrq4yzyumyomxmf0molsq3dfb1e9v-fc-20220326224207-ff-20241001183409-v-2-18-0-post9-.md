description: Cyp2c70 knockout (KO) mice lack the liver enzyme responsible for synthesis
  of 6-hydroxylated muricholate bile acid species and possess a more hydrophobic human-like
  bile acid composition. Cyp2c70 KO mice develop cholestatic liver injury that can
  be prevented by administration of an ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) inhibitor.
  In this study, we investigated the potential of an ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT)
  inhibitor (SC-435) and steroidal FXR agonist (cilofexor) to modulate ...
