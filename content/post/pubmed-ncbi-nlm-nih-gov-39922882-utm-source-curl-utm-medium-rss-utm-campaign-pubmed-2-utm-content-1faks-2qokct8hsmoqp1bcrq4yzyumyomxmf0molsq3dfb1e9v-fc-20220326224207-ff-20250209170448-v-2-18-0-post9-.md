description: Our retrospective single-center study aims to evaluate the impact of
  structured reporting (SR) using a self-developed template on report quality compared
  to free-text reporting (FTR) in [^(18)F]SiTATE Positron Emission Tomography/Computer
  Tomography (PET/CT) for the primary staging and therapy monitoring of patients diagnosed
  with neuroendocrine tumors (NET). In total 50 patients were included. FTRs and SRs
  were generated post-examination. All reports were evaluated by a radiologist and
