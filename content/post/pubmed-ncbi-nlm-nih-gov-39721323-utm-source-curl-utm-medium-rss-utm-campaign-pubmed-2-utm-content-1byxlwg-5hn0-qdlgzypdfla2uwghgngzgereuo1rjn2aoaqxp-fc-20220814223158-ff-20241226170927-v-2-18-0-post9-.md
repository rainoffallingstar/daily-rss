description: It has been demonstrated that diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is
  especially sensitive to ferroptosis. Currently, confirming the presence of ferroptosis
  requires flow cytometry, which is a time consuming and labor-intensive task. Blistering
  of the cell membrane has been shown to be a ferroptosis-specific morphological change.
  In this study we developed a deep convolutional neural network to detect the blistering
  of cell membrane. Buthionine sulfoximine treatment increased the percentage ...
