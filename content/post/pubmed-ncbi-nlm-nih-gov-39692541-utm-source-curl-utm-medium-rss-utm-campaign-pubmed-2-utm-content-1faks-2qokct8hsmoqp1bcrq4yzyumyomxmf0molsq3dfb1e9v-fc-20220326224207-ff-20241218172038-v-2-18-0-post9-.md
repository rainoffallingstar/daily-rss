description: The progression-free-survival ratio is a popular endpoint in oncology
  trials, which is frequently applied to evaluate the efficacy of molecularly targeted
  treatments in late-stage patients. Using elementary calculations and simulations,
  numerous shortcomings of the current methodology are pointed out. As a remedy to
  these shortcomings, an alternative methodology is proposed, using a marginal Cox
  model or a marginal accelerated failure time model for clustered time-to-event data.
