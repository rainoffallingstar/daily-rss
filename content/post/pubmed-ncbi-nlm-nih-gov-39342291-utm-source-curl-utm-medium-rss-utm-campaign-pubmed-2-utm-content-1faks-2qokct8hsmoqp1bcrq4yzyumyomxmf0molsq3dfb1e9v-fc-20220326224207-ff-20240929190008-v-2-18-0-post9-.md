description: Assessing the prognosis of patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin B cell
  lymphoma mainly relies on a clinical risk score (IPI). Standard first-line therapies
  are based on a chemo-immunotherapy with rituximab, which mediates CD16-dependent
  antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). We phenotypically and functionally
  analyzed blood samples from 46 patients focusing on CD16+ NK cells, CD16+ T cells
  and CD16+ monocytes. Kaplan-Meier survival curves show a superior progression-free
