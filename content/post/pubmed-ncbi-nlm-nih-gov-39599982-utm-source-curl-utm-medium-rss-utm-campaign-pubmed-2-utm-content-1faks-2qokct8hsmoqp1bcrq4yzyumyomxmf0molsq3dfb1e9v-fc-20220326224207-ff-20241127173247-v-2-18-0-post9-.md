description: The study investigated the impact of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
  (NSAIDs) on burn-induced coagulopathy in severely burned patients. Patients with
  a greater than 20% TBSA were identified in the TriNetX research network and categorized
  into receiving or not receiving NSAIDs in the first week after the burn. The statistical
  significance of the rate of burn-induced coagulopathy, mortality and sepsis in the
  week following injury was analysed. We observed 837 severely burned patients ...
