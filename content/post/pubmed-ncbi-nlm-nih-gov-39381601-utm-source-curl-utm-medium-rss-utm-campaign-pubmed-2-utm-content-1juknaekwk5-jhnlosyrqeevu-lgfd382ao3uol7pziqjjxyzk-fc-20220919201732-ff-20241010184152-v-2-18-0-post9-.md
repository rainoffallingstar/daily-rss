description: Primary atopic disorders (PAD) are monogenic disorders caused by pathogenic
  gene variants encoding proteins that are key for the maintenance of a healthy skin
  barrier and a well-functioning immune system. Physicians face the challenge to find
  single, extremely rare PAD patients/families among the millions of individuals with
  common allergic diseases. We describe case scenarios with signature PAD. We review
  the literature and deduct specific clinical red flags for PAD detection. They include
