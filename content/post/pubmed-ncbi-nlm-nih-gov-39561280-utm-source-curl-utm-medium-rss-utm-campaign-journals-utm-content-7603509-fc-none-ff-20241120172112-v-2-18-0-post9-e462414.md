description: Rising blast-percentage or secondary (s) AML transformation (sAML) in
  MPNs leads to JAK inhibitor (JAKi) therapy-resistance and poor survival. Here, we
  demonstrate that the CDK7 inhibitor (CDK7i) SY-5609 treatment depletes phenotypically-characterized
  post-MPN-sAML stem/progenitor cells. In the cultured post-MPN sAML SET2 and HEL
  as well as patient-derived (PD) post-MPN-sAML cells, SY-5609 treatment inhibited
  growth and induced lethality, while sparing normal cells. RNA-Seq analysis ...
