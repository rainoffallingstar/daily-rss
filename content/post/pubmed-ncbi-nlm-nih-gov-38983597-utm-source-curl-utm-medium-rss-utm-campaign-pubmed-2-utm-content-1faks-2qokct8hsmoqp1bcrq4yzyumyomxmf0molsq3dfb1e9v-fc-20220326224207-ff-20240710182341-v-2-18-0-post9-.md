description: Crucial to the performance of devices based on organic molecules is an
  understanding of how the substrate-molecule interface influences both structural
  and electronic properties of the molecular layers. Within this context we studied
  the self-assembly of an alkoxy-triphenylene derived electron donor (HAT) in the
  monolayer regime on graphene/Ni(111). The molecules assembled into a close-packed
  hexagonal network commensurate with the graphene layer. Despite the commensurate
  structure, the ...
