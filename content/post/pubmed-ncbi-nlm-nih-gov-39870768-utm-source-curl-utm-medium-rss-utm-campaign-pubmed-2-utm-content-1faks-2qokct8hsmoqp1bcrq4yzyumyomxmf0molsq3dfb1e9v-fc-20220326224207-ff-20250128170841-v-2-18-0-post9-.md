description: Refractory disease and relapse are major challenges in acute myeloid
  leukemia (AML) therapy attributed to survival of leukemic stem cells (LSC). To target
  LSCs, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) provide an elegant solution, combining the
  specificity of antibodies with highly potent payloads. We aimed to investigate if
  FLT3-20D9h3-ADCs delivering either the DNA-alkylator duocarmycin (DUBA) or the microtubule-toxin
  monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF) can eradicate quiescent LSCs. We show here that ...
