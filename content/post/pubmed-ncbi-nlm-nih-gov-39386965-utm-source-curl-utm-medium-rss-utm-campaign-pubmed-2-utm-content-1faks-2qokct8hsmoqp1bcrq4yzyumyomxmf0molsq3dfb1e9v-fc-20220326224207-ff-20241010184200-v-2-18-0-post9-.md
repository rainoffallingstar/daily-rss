description: Critical knowledge gaps have impeded progress towards reducing the global
  burden of disease due to Mycobacterium ulcerans, the cause of the neglected tropical
  disease Buruli ulcer (BU). Development of a controlled human infection model of
  BU has been proposed as an experimental platform to explore host-pathogen interactions
  and evaluate tools for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. We have previously
