description: Small cell carcinoma of the ovary-hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) is a rare
  ovarian cancer affecting young females and is driven by the loss of both SWI/SNF
  ATPases SMARCA4 and SMARCA2. As loss of SWI/SNF alters enhancers, we hypothesized
  that super-enhancers, which regulate oncogene expression in cancer, are disparately
  impacted by SWI/SNF loss. We discovered differences between SWI/SNF occupancy at
  enhancers vs. super-enhancers. SCCOHT super-enhancer target genes were enriched
  in ...
