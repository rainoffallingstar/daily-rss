description: Besides sepsis and malignancy, malperfusion is the third leading cause
  of tissue degradation and a major pathomechanism for various medical and surgical
  conditions. Despite significant developments such as bypass surgery, endovascular
  procedures, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and artificial blood substitutes,
  tissue malperfusion, especially of visceral organs, remains a pressing issue in
  patient care. The demand for further research on biomedical processes and possible
