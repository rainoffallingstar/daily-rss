description: The virus particles of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) are
  released in an immature, non-infectious form. Proteolytic cleavage of the main structural
  polyprotein Gag into functional domains induces rearrangement into mature, infectious
  virions. In immature virus particles, the Gag membrane-binding domain, MA, forms
  a hexameric protein lattice that undergoes structural transition, following cleavage,
  into a distinct, mature MA lattice¹. The mechanism of MA lattice maturation ...
