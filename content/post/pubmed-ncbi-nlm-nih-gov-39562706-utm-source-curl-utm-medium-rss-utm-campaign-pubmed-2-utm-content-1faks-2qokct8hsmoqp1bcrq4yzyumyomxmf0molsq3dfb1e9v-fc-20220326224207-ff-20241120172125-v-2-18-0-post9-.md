description: Activation of microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous
  system, leading to the subsequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, has been
  linked to cardiac remodeling, autonomic disbalance, and cognitive deficits in heart
  failure (HF). While previous studies emphasized the role of hippocampal Angiotensin
  II (AngII) signaling in HF-induced microglial activation, unanswered mechanistic
  questions persist. Evidence suggests significant interactions between microglia
