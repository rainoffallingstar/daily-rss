  biotechnology and ecological nitrogen cycling. The holistic genetic profiles of
  microbiomes can be provided by meta-omics. However, precise decryption and further
  applications of highly complex microbiomes and corresponding meta-omics data sets
  remain great challenges. Here, we combined optogenetics and geometric deep learning
