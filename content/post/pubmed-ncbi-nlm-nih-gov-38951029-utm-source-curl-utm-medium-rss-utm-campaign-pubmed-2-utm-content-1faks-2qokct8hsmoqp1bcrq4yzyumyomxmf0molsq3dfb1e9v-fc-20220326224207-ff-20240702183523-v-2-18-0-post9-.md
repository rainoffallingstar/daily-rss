description: Lipids have essential functions as structural components of cellular
  membranes, as efficient energy storage molecules, and as precursors of signaling
  mediators. While deregulated glucose and amino acid metabolism in cancer have received
  substantial attention, the roles of lipids in the metabolic reprogramming of cancer
  cells are less well understood. However, since the first description of de novo
  fatty acid biosynthesis in cancer tissues almost 70 years ago, numerous studies
