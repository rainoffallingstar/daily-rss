description: Ascorbate (vitamin C) limits hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function and
  suppresses leukemia development, partly by promoting the function of the Tet2 tumor
  suppressor. In humans, ascorbate is obtained from the diet while in mice it is synthesized
  in the liver. In this study, we show that deletion of the Slc23a2 ascorbate transporter
  from hematopoietic cells depleted ascorbate to undetectable levels in HSCs and MPPs
  without altering plasma ascorbate levels. Slc23a2 deficiency increased ...
