description: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 50% of patients with heart failure.
  The pathophysiology of CKD in heart failure is proposed to be driven by macrocirculatory
  hemodynamic changes, including reduced cardiac output and elevated central venous
  pressure. However, our understanding of the renal microcirculation in heart failure
  and CKD remains limited. This is largely due to the lack of non-invasive techniques
  to assess the renal microcirculation in patients. Moreover, there is a lack ...
