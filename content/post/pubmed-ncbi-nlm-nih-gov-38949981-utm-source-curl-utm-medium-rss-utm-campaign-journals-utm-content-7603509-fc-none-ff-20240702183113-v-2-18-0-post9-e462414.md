description: -Thalassemia (AT) is one of the most commonly occurring inherited hematological
  diseases. However, few treatments are available, and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation
  (BMT) is the only available therapeutic option for patients with severe AT. Research
  into AT has remained limited due to a lack of adult mouse models, with severe AT
  typically resulting in in utero lethality. By using a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) targeting
