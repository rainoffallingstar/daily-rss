description: Epigenetic modulators such as lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) and
  histone deacetylases (HDACs) are drug targets for cancer, neuropsychiatric disease,
  or inflammation, but inhibitors of these enzymes exhibit considerable side effects.
  For a potential local treatment with reduced systemic toxicity, we present here
  soft drug candidates as new LSD1 and HDAC inhibitors. A soft drug is a compound
  that is degraded in vivo to less active metabolites after having achieved its therapeutic
