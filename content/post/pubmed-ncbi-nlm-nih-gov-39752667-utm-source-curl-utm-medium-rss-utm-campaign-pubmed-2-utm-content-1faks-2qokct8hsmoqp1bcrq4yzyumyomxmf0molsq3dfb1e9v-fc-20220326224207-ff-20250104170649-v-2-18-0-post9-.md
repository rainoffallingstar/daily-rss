description: The CONUS experiment studies coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering
  in four 1 kg germanium spectrometers. Low ionization energy thresholds of 210 eV
  were achieved. The detectors were operated inside an optimized shield at the Brokdorf
  nuclear power plant which provided a reactor antineutrino flux of up to 2.3×10^{13}
  cm^{-2} s^{-1}. In the final phase of data collection at this site, the constraints
  on the neutrino interaction rate were improved by an order of magnitude as compared
  to ...
