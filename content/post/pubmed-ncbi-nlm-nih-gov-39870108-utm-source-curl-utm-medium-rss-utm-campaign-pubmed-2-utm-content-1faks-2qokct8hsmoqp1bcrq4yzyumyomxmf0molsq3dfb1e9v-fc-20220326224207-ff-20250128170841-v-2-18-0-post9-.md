  not possible. Inherited platelet function disorders (iPFDs) can affect surface receptors
  and multiple platelet responses such as defects of platelet granules, signal transduction,
  and procoagulant activity. If iPFDs are also associated with a reduced platelet
  count (thrombocytopenia), it is not uncommon to be misdiagnosed as immune thrombocytopenia.
