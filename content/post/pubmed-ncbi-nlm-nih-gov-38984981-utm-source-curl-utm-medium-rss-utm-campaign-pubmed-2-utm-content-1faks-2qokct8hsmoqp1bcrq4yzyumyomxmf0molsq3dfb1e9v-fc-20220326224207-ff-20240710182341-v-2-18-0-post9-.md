description: 'A series of cyclopentadienyllanthanum complexes with the disilylated
  metalloid germanium cluster [Ge(9)(Hyp)(2)]^(2-) [Hyp = Si(SiMe(3))(3)] has been
  prepared and fully characterized. The synthetic procedure is based on the salt metathesis
  reaction of two different cyclopentadienyllanthanum diiodides CpLaI(2) (Cp: Cp*,
  pentamethylcyclopentadienyl; Cp^(ttt), 1,2,4-tri-tert-butylcyclopentadienyl) with
  K(2)[Ge(9)(Hyp)(2)] in tetrahydrofuran (THF) with a subsequent extraction with n-hexane.
