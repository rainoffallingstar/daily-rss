description: Glioblastoma (GBM) is described as a group of highly malignant primary
  brain tumors and stands as one of the most lethal malignancies. The genetic and
  cellular characteristics of GBM have been a focal point of ongoing research, revealing
  that it is a group of heterogeneous diseases with variations in RNA expression,
  DNA methylation, or cellular composition. Despite the wealth of molecular data available,
  the lack of transferable pre-clinic models has limited the application of this ...
