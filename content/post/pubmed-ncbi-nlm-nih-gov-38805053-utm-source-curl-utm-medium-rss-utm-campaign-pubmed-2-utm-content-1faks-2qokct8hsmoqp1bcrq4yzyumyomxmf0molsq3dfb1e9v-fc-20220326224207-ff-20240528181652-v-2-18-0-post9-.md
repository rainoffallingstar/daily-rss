description: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease
  characterized by the progressive degeneration of both upper and lower motor neurons.
  A defining histopathological feature in approximately 97% of all ALS cases is the
  accumulation of phosphorylated trans-activation response (TAR) DNA-binding protein
  43 protein (pTDP-43) aggregates in the cytoplasm of neurons and glial cells within
  the central nervous system. Traditionally, it was believed that the accumulation
