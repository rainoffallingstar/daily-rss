description: Novel microporous polymers were synthesized through Yamamoto polymerization
  of selectively brominated spirofluorene-bridged N-heterotriangulenes. Extensive
  characterization, including combustion analysis, ToF-SIMS, IR, and Raman spectroscopy,
  confirmed the elemental composition and integrity of the polymers. The amorphous
  polymers, observed by scanning electron microscopy as globular particles aggregating
  into larger structures, exhibited remarkable thermal stability (decomposition ...
