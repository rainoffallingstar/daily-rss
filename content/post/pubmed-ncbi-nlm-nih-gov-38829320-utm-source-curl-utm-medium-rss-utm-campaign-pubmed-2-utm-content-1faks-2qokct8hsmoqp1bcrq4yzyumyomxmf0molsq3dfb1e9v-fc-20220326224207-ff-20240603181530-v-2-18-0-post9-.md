description: When participants study items one-by-one and are directed to either remember
  or forget the respective item directly after its presentation, retention of to-be-forgotten
  items is regularly worse than of to-be-remembered items. We tested whether this
  directed forgetting effect which is regularly observed for item memory generalizes
  to source memory. In three experiments, participants studied items in two different
  source colors (N = 101) or at two different source locations (N = 64; N = ...
