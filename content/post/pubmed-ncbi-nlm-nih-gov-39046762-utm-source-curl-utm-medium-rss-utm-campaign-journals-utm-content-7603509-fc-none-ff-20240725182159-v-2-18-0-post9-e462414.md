description: Atypical acute promyelocytic leukemia (aAPL) presents a complex landscape
  of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) fusion genes beyond the well-known PML::RARA fusion.
  Among these, 31 individually rare RARA and RARG fusion genes have been documented,
  often reported in the canonical X::RAR bipartite fusion form. Intriguingly, some
  artificially mimicked bipartite X::RAR fusions respond well to all-trans retinoic
  acid (ATRA) in vitro, contrasting with the ATRA resistance observed in patients.
