description: Pineal gland lesions pose a significant surgical challenge due to the
  deep-seated nature of the pineal gland, as well as the limited field of view, and
  the complex vascular anatomy. The mainstay of surgical treatment, when necessary,
  is always histopathological clarity and gross total resection (GTR). We evaluate
  the surgical outcomes for pineal gland lesions, shedding light on functional outcomes,
  histological findings, and surgical complications. We analyzed patients with pineal
