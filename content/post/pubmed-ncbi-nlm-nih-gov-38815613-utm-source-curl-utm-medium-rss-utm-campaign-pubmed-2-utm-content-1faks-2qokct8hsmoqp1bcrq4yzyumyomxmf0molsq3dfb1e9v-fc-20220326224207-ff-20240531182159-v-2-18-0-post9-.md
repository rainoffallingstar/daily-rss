description: Objective:There is an increasing interest in calculating and measuring
  linear energy transfer (LET) spectra in particle therapy in order to assess their
  impact in biological terms. As such, the accuracy of the particle fluence energy
  spectra becomes paramount. This study focuses on quantifying energy depositions
  of distinct proton, helium, carbon, and oxygen ion beams using a silicon pixel detector
  developed at CERN to determine LET spectra in silicon.Approach:While detection systems
