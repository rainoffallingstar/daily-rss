description: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) based on common single nucleotide
  polymorphisms (SNPs) have identified several loci associated with the risk of monoclonal
  gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS), a precursor condition for multiple myeloma
  (MM). We hypothesized that analyzing haplotypes might be more useful than analyzing
  individual SNPs, as it could identify functional chromosomal units that collectively
  contribute to MGUS risk. To test this hypothesis, we used data from our ...
