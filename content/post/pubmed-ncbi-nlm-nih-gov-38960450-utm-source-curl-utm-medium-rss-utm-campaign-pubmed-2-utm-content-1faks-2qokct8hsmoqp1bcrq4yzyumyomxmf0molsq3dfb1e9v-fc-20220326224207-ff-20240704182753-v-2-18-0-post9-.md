description: Eligibility criteria for lung cancer screening increasingly need to consider
  family history of lung cancer, as well as age and smoking status. Lung cancer screening
  will reveal a multitude of incidental findings, of variable clinical significance,
  and with a need for clear pathways of management. Pulmonary nodule sampling is enhanced
  by intra-procedural imaging and cutting-edge robotic technology. Systematic thoracic
  lymph node sampling has implications for treatment efficacy. ...
