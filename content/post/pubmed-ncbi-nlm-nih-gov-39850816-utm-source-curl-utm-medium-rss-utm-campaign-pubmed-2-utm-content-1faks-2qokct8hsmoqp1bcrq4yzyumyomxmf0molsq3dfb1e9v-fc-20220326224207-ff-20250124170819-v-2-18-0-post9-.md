description: 'CONCLUSIONS: The overexpression of SLPI caused by tobacco-smoking can
  hinder HPV cell entry by binding to AnxA2 and thus prevent successful HPV infection.
  Conversely, non-smokers have lower SLPI-levels, associated with an excess of unbound
  AnxA2, favoring HPV cell-entry. These findings support our hypothesis, suggesting
  a paradigm shift in understanding virus-related pathogenesis, particularly in the
  head and neck region, and the nature of HPV ...'
