description: Systemic AL amyloidosis is one of the most frequently diagnosed forms
  of systemic amyloidosis. It arises from mutational changes in immunoglobulin light
  chains. To explore whether these mutations may affect the structure of the formed
  fibrils, we determine and compare the fibril structures from several patients with
  cardiac AL amyloidosis. All patients are affected by light chains that contain an
  IGLV3-19 gene segment, and the deposited fibrils differ by the mutations within
  this common ...
