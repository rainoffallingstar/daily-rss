description: The ribosome maturation factor Rea1 (or Midasin) catalyses the removal
  of assembly factors from large ribosomal subunit precursors and promotes their export
  from the nucleus to the cytosol. Rea1 consists of nearly 5000 amino-acid residues
  and belongs to the AAA+ protein family. It consists of a ring of six AAA+ domains
  from which the ≈1700 amino-acid residue linker emerges that is subdivided into stem,
  middle and top domains. A flexible and unstructured D/E rich region connects the
  linker top ...
