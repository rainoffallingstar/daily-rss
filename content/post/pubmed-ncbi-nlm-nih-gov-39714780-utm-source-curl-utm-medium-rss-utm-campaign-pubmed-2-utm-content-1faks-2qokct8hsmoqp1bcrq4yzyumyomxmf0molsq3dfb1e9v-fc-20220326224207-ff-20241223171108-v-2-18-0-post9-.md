CONCLUSIONS: Carbon-ion therapy monitoring with charged nuclear fragments was shown to be capable of detecting clinically relevant density changes in an anthropomorphic head phantom under realistic clinic-like conditions. The complexity of the observed signal requires the development of advanced analysis techniques and underscores the importance of Monte Carlo simulations.
