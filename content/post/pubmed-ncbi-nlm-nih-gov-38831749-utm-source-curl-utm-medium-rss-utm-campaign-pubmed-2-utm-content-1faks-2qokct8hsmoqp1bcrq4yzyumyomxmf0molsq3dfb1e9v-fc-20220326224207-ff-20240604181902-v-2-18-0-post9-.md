description: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a classical cellular plasticity
  process induced by various cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic triggers. Although prominent
  factors, such as TGFβ, mediate EMT via well-characterized pathways, alternative
  avenues are less well understood. Transcriptomic subtyping of pancreatic ductal
  adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has demonstrated that basal-like PDACs enrich a mesenchymal-like
  expression program, emphasizing the relevance of EMT in the disease. In this issue
