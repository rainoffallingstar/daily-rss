description: A case of cutaneous adnexal neoplasm with unusual squamoid morphology
  and harboring an in frame ACTB::ZMIZ2 fusion transcript was recently described.
  Herein, we report a second case of adnexal carcinoma harboring similar morphology
  and an identical in frame ACTB::ZMIZ2 fusion transcript. This 2.2-cm mass was removed
  from the axilla of a 17-year-old woman. Microscopic examination revealed a large
  nodular and infiltrative tumor invading the dermis composed of sheets and nests
