  D-A combinations can effectively improve organic photovoltaic (OPV) device performance.
  However, to obtain excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE), the trial-and-error
  structural design in the infinite chemical space is time-consuming and costly. Herein,
  a deep learning (DL)-assisted design framework for OPV materials is proposed. To
  effectively digitally represent the D and A structures, a structure ...
