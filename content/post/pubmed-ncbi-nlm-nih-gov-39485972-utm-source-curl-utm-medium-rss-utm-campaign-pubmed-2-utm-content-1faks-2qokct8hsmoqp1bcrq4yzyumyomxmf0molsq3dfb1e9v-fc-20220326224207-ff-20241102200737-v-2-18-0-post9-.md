description: By exciting a series of 1s^{2} ^{1}S_{0}→1snp^{1}P_{1} transitions in
  heliumlike nitrogen ions with linearly polarized monochromatic soft x rays at the
  Elettra facility, we found a change in the angular distribution of the fluorescence
  sensitive to the principal quantum number n. In particular it is observed that the
  ratio of emission in directions parallel and perpendicular to the polarization of
  incident radiation increases with higher n. We find this n dependence to be a manifestation
  of ...
