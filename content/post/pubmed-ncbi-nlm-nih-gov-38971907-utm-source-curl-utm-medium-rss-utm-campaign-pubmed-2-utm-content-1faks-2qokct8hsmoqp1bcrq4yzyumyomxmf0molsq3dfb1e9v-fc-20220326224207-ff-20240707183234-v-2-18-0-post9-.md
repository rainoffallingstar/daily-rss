  tumor with poor prognosis. Novel immunotherapeutic approaches are currently under
  investigation. Even though magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most important
  imaging tool for treatment monitoring, response assessment is often hampered by
  therapy-related tissue changes. As tumor and therapy-associated tissue reactions
  differ structurally, we hypothesize that biomechanics could be a pertinent imaging
