description: Inclusion of adaptive design features in a clinical trial provides preplanned
  flexibility to dynamically modify a trial during its conduct while preserving validity
  and integrity. Adaptive trials are needed to accelerate the conduct of more efficient,
  informative, and ethical clinical research in the field of neurology. Stroke is
  a natural candidate for adoption of these innovative approaches to trial design.
