description: This study presents a systematic method to simulate various intraocular
  lenses (IOLs) available in the market. Five IOLs (two trifocals, one bifocal, one
  enhanced monofocal, and one extended depth of focus (EDOF)) were evaluated in terms
  of through focus visual Strehl (TFVS) utilizing the OptiSpheric IOL PRO2 device
  (Trioptics GmbH). Then, the estimated TFVS (ETFVS) and the temporal coefficients
  necessary for temporal multiplexing were computed, and through an iterative process,
  the SimVis ...
