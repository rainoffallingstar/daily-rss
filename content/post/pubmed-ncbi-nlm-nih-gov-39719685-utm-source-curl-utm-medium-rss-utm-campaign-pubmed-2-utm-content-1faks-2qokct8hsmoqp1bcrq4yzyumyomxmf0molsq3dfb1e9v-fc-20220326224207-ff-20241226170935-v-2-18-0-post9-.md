description: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most prevalent human inflammatory disease
  of the central nervous system with demyelination and glial scar formation as pathological
  hallmarks. Glial cells are key drivers of lesion progression in MS with roles in
  both tissue damage and repair depending on the surrounding microenvironment and
  the functional state of the individual glial subtype. In this review, we describe
  recent developments in the context of glial cell diversity in MS summarizing key
