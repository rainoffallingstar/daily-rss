description: Reported are the synthesis and detailed studies of the iron(IV)-tosylimido
  complexes of two isomeric pentadentate bispidine ligands (bispidines are 3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane
  derivatives). This completes a series of five tosylimido complexes with comparable
  pentadentate amine/pyridine ligands, where the corresponding [(L)Fe^(IV)═O]^(2+)
  oxidants have been studied in detail. The characterization of the two new complexes
  in solution (UV-vis-NIR, Mössbauer, HR-ESI-MS) shows that these ...
