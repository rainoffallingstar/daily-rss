description: A series of 3,3"- and 4,4"-dimethoxy terphenyls with different second
  substituents on their ortho-positions have been synthesized and investigated upon
  the possibility to be oxidatively cyclodehydrogenated to the corresponding triphenylenes
  under Scholl-type conditions. The experimentally obtained selectivities were supported
  and explained by quantum chemical calculations and conclusions on the involved mechanisms
  (acid catalyzed arenium-ion mechanism (AIM) vs radical cation mechanism) ...
