description: Protein glycosylation regulates essential cellular processes such as
  signaling, adhesion and cell-cell interactions; however, dysregulated glycosylation
  is associated with diseases such as cancer. Here we introduce deep quantitative
  glycoprofiling (DQGlyco), a robust method that integrates high-throughput sample
  preparation, highly sensitive detection and precise multiplexed quantification to
  investigate protein glycosylation dynamics at an unprecedented depth. Using DQGlyco,
  we profiled ...
