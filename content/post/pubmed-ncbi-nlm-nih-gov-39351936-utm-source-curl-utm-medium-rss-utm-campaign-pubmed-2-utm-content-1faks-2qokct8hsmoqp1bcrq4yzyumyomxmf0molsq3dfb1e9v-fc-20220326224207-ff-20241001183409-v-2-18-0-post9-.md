description: We present a comprehensive, combined experimental and theoretical study
  of the core-level photoelectron and near-edge x-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS)
  spectra of 2-thiouracil, 4-thiouracil, and 2,4-dithiouracil at the oxygen 1s, nitrogen
  1s, carbon 1s, and the sulfur 2s and 2p edges. X-ray photoelectron spectra were
  calculated using equation-of-motion coupled-cluster theory (EOM-CCSD), and NEXAFS
  spectra were calculated using algebraic diagrammatic construction and EOM-CCSD.
