description: 'CONCLUSION: This is the largest study to date in European pKTRs on a
  tacrolimus-based immunosuppressive regimen, and it shows important age-related differences
  in rejection rates, infection episodes, as well as tacrolimus exposure and clearance.
  This data suggests that immunosuppressive therapy in pKTRs should be tailored and
  personalized according to the age-specific risk profiles of this heterogeneous patient
  population. The data may serve as a benchmark for future studies with ...'
