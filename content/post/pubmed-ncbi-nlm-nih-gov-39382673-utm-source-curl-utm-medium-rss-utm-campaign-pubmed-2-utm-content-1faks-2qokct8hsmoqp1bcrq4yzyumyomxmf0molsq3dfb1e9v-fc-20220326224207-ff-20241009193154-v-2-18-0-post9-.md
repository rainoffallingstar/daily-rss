description: Cardiac macrophages facilitate electrical conduction through the atrioventricular-node
  (AV) in mice. A possible role for cardiomyocyte-macrophage coupling on the effect
  of antiarrhythmic therapy has not been investigated yet. Holter monitoring was conducted
  in LysM^(Cre)xCsf1r^(LsL-DTR) mice (MM^(DTR)) under baseline conditions and after
  an elctrophysiological stress test by flecainide. In vivo effects were recapitulated
  in vitro by patch-clamp experiments. The underlying mechanism ...
