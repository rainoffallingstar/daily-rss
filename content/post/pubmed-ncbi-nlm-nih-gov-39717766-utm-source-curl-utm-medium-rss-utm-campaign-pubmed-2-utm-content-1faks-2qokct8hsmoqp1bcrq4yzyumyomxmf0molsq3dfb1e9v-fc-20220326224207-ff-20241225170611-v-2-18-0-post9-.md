description: Recent studies have revealed the potential of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
  (TILs) to treat solid tumors effectively and safely. However, the translation of
  TIL therapy for patients is still hampered by non-standardized and laborious manufacturing
  procedures that are expensive and produce highly variable cellular products. To
  address these limitations, the CliniMACS Prodigy^(®) Tumor Reactive T cell (TRT)
  Process has been developed. The TRT Process allows the automated isolation, ...
