description: 'Purpose: To assess the diagnostic performance of contrast-enhanced ultrasound
  (CEUS) alongside contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) in evaluating central
  lung cancer (CLC). Materials and Methods: From 2006 to 2022, 54 patients with CLC
  and obstructive atelectasis (OAT) underwent standardized examinations using CEUS
  in addition to CECT. The ability to differentiate CLC from atelectatic tissue in
  CECT and CEUS was categorized as distinguishable or indistinguishable. In CEUS,
