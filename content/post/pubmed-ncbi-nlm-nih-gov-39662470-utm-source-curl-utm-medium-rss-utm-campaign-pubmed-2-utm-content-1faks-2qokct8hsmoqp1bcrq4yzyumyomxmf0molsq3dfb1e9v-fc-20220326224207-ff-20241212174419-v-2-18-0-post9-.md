description: Mammalian ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules are highly abundant RNAs, decorated
  with over 220 rRNA modifications. Previous works have shown that some rRNA modification
  types can be dynamically regulated; however, how and when the mammalian rRNA modification
  landscape is remodeled remains largely unexplored. Here, we employ direct RNA sequencing
  to chart the human and mouse rRNA epitranscriptome across tissues, developmental
  stages, cell types, and disease. Our analyses reveal multiple rRNA ...
