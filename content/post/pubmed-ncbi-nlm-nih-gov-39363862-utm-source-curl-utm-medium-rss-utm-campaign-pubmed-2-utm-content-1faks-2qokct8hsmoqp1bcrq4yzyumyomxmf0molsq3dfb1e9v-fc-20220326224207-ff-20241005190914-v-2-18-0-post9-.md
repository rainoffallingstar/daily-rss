description: We evaluated response to VEN/HMA in 46 patients with acute myeloid leukemia
  (AML) characterized by extramedullary disease (EMD). Median age was 65 (range, 19-81)
  years. Patients had a median of two EMD sites (range, 1-5) and 35 (76%) patients
  had concurrent bone marrow involvement. Twenty (43%) patients had highrisk genetic
  features according to the European Leukemia Net 2022 classification. Twenty-nine
  (63%) were relapsed or refractory after intensive chemotherapy (CTX) including 13
