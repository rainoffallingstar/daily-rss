  support may develop inadequate platelet count increments, referred to as Platelet
  Refractoriness (PR), which further complicates their care. The underlying etiologies
  of PR can be broadly divided into immune and non-immune causes. A high index of

  in immune PR is development of Class I Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) antibodies.
