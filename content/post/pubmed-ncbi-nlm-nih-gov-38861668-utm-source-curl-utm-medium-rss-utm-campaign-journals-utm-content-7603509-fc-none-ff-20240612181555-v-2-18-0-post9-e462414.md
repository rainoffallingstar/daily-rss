description: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies have demonstrated transformative
  efficacy in treating B-cell malignancies. However, high cost and manufacturing complexities
  hinder their widespread use. To overcome these hurdles, we have developed the VivoVecTM
  platform, a lentiviral vector capable of generating CAR T-cells in vivo. Here we
  describe the incorporation of T cell activation and costimulatory signals onto the
  surface of VivoVecTM particles (VVPs) in the form of a multi-domain ...
