description: Signaling proteins in eukaryotes usually comprise a catalytic domain
  coupled to one or several interaction domains, such as SH2 and SH3 domains. An additional
  class of proteins critically involved in cellular communication are adapter or scaffold
  proteins, which fulfill their purely non-enzymatic functions by organizing protein-protein
  interactions. Intriguingly, certain signaling enzymes, e.g., kinases and phosphatases,
  have been demonstrated to promote particular cellular functions by means ...
