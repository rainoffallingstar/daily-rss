description: Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) technologies provide unprecedented resolution
  representing transcriptomics at the level of single cell. One of the biggest challenges
  in scRNA-seq data analysis is the cell type annotation, which is usually inferred
  by cell separation approaches. In-silico algorithms that accurately identify individual
  cell types in ongoing single-cell sequencing studies are crucial for unlocking cellular
  heterogeneity and understanding the biological basis of diseases. In ...
