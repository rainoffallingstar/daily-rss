description: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) significantly aggravates human dignity and quality
  of life. While newly approved amyloid immunotherapy has been reported, effective
  AD drugs remain to be identified. Here, we propose a novel AI-driven drug-repurposing
  method, DeepDrug, to identify a lead combination of approved drugs to treat AD patients.
  DeepDrug advances drug-repurposing methodology in four aspects. Firstly, it incorporates
  expert knowledge to extend candidate targets to include long ...
