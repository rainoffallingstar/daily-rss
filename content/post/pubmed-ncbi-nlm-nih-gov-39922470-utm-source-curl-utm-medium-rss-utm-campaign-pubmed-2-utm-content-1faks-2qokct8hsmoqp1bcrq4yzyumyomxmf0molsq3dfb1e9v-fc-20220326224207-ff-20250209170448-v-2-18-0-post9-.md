  with greater fatigue, while protein and fat intake are associated with lower fatigue
  in CRC survivors up to 1 year post-treatment. While all KP metabolites simultaneously
  did not significantly mediate associations between diet and fatigue in our population,
  the KA/QA ratio and HKr were significant mediators in several diet-fatigue associations.
