description: Mass measurements of ^{31-33}Na and ^{31-35}Mg using the TITAN MR-TOF-MS
  at TRIUMF's ISAC facility are presented, with the uncertainty of the ^{33}Na mass
  reduced by over 2 orders of magnitude. The excellent performance of the MR-TOF-MS
  has also allowed the discovery of a millisecond isomer in ^{32}Na. The precision
  obtained shows that the binding energy of the normally closed N=20 neutron shell
  reaches a minimum for ^{32}Mg but increases significantly for ^{31}Na, hinting at
  the possibility ...
