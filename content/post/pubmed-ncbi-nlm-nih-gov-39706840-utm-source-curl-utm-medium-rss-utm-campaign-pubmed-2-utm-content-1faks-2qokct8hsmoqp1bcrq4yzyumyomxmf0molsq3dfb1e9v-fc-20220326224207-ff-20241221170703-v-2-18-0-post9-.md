description: The dynamics of three-dimensional (3D) genome organization are essential
  to transcriptional regulation. While enhancers regulate spatiotemporal gene expression,
  chromatin looping is a means for enhancer-promoter interactions yielding cell-type-specific
  gene expression. Further, non-canonical DNA secondary structures, such as G-quadruplexes
  (G4s), are related to increased gene expression. However, the role of G4s in promoter-distal
  regulatory elements, such as super-enhancers (SE), and ...
