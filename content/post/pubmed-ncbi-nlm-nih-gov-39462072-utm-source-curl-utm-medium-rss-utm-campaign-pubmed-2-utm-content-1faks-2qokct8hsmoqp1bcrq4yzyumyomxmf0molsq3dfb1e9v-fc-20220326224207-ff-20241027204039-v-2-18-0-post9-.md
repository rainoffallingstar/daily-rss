description: This systematic review investigates the efficacy of metabolite biomarkers
  for risk assessment or early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) and its precursors,
  focusing on pre-diagnostic biospecimens. Searches in PubMed, Web of Science, and
  SCOPUS through December 2023 identified relevant prospective studies. Relevant data
  were extracted, and the risk of bias was assessed with the QUADAS-2 tool. Among
  the 26 studies included, significant heterogeneity existed for case numbers, ...
