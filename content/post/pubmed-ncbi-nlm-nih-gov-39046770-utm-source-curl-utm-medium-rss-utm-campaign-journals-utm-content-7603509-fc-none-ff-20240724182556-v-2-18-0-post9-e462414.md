description: The histone H3K27 demethylase KDM6A is a tumor suppressor in multiple
  cancers, including multiple myeloma (MM). We created isogenic MM cells disrupted
  for KDM6A and tagged the endogenous protein to facilitate genome wide studies. KDM6A
  binds genes associated with immune recognition and cytokine signaling. Most importantly,
  KDM6A binds and activates NLRC5 and CIITA encoding regulators of Major Histocompatibility
  Complex (MHC) genes. Patient data indicate that NLRC5 and CIITA, are downregulated
