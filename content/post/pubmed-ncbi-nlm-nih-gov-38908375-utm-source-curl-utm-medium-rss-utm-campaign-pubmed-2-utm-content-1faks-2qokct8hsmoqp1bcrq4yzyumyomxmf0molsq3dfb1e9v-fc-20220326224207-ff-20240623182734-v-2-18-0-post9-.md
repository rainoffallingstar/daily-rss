description: The neurodevelopmental disorders Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Schaaf-Yang
  syndrome (SYS) both arise from genomic alterations within human chromosome 15q11-q13.
  A deletion of the SNORD116 cluster, encoding small nucleolar RNAs, or frameshift
  mutations within MAGEL2 result in closely related phenotypes in individuals with
  PWS or SYS, respectively. By investigation of their subcellular localization, we
  observed that in contrast to a predominant cytoplasmic localization of wild-type
