description: Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) is poised to advance the understanding
  of cellular organization within complex tissues under various physiological and
  pathological conditions at unprecedented resolution. Despite the development of
  numerous computational tools that facilitate the automatic identification of statistically
  significant intra-/inter-slice patterns (like spatial domains), these methods typically
  operate in an unsupervised manner, without leveraging sample characteristics ...
