description: Immune effector cell-associated hematotoxicity (ICAHT) is a major B-cell
  targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell related toxicity. While ICAHT incidence
  and severity is documented in large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL), mantle cell lymphoma
  (MCL), and multiple myeloma (MM), ICAHT has not been described in B-cell acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia (B-ALL). Similarly, the CAR-HEMATOTOX (CAR-HT) model, designed to predict
  severe prolonged neutropenia (>14 days of ANC <500/µl), has been validated ...
