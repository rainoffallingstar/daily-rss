description: Of the seven in absentia homologue (SIAH) family, three members have
  been identified in the human genome. In contrast to the E3 ubiquitin ligase encoding
  SIAH1 and SIAH2, little is known on the regulation and function of SIAH3 in tumorigenesis.
  In this study, we reveal that SIAH3 is frequently epigenetically silenced in different
  cancer entities, including cutaneous melanoma, lung adenocarcinoma and head and
  neck cancer. Low SIAH3 levels correlate with an impaired survival of cancer ...
