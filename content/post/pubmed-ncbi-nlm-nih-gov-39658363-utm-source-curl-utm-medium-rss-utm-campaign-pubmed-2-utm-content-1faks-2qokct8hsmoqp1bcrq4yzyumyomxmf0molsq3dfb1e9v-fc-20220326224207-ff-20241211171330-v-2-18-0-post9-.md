description: Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an increasingly needed, life-maintaining
  kidney replacement therapy; efficient solute transport is critical for patient outcome.
  While the role of peritoneal perfusion on solute transport in PD has been described,
  the role of cellular barriers is uncertain, the mesothelium has been considered
  irrelevant. We calculated peritoneal blood microvascular endothelial (BESA) to mesothelial
  surface area (MSA) ratio in human peritonea in health, chronic kidney disease, and
