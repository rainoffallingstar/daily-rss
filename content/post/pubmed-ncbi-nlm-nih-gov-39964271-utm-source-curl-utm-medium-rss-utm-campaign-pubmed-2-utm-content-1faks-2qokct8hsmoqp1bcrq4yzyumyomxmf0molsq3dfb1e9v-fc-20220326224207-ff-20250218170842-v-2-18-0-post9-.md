description: Background Since the introduction of TotalSegmentator CT, there has been
  demand for a similar robust automated MRI segmentation tool that can be applied
  across all MRI sequences and anatomic structures. Purpose To develop and evaluate
  an automated MRI segmentation model for robust segmentation of major anatomic structures
  independent of MRI sequence. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study,
  an nnU-Net model (TotalSegmentator MRI) was trained on MRI and CT scans to segment
  80 ...
