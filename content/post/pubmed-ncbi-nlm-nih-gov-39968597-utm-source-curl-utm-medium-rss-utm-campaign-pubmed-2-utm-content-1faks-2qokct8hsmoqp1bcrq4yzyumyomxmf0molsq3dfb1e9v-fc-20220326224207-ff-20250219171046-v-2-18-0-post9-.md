description: Time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) is deemed to be a formally
  rigorous way of dealing with the time-evolution of a many-electron system at the
  level of electron densities rather than the underlying wavefunctions, which in turn
  provides an, in principle, exact density-based approach to the treatment of electron
  excitations in atoms and molecules. This claim has not remained unchallenged, and
