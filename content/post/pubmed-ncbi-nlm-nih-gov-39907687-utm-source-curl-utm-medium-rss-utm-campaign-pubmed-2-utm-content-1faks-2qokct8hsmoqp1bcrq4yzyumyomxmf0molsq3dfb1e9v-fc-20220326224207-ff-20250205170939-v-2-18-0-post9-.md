  shared mechanism in myocardial structural/functional impairment, reduced exercise
  capacity, and restricted haematopoiesis in heart failure, which are worse in patients
  with anaemia, and improve with empagliflozin. Empagliflozin increases MIC and decreases

  diverse cardiac and systemic benefits from SGLT2i ...'
