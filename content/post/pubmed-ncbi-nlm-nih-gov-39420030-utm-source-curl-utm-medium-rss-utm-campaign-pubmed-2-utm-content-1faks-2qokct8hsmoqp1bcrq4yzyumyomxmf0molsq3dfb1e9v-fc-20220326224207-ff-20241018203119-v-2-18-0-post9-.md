description: Torpor encompasses diverse adaptations to extreme environmental stressors
  such as hibernation, aestivation, brumation, and daily torpor. Here we introduce
  StrokeofGenus, an analytic pipeline that identifies distinct transcriptomic states
  and shared gene expression patterns across studies, tissues, and species. We use
  StrokeofGenus to study multiple and diverse forms of torpor from publicly-available
  RNA-seq datasets that span eight species and two classes. We identify three ...
