description: Post-injury dysfunction of humoral immunity accounts for infections and
  poor outcomes in cardiovascular diseases. Among immunoglobulins (Ig), IgA, the most
  abundant mucosal antibody, is produced by plasma B cells in intestinal Peyer's patches
  (PP) and lamina propria. Here we show that patients with stroke and myocardial ischemia
  (MI) had strongly reduced IgA blood levels. This was phenocopied in experimental
  mouse models where decreased plasma and fecal IgA were accompanied by rapid loss
