description: Alloimmunization during pregnancy occurs when a mother produces antibodies
  against fetal antigens, leading to complications like hemolytic disease of the fetus
  and newborn (HDFN) and fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT). HDFN
  involves destruction of fetal red blood cells, potentially causing severe anemia,
  hydrops fetalis, and fetal death. FNAIT affects fetal platelets and possibly endothelial
  cells, resulting in risk of intracranial hemorrhage and brain damage. ...
