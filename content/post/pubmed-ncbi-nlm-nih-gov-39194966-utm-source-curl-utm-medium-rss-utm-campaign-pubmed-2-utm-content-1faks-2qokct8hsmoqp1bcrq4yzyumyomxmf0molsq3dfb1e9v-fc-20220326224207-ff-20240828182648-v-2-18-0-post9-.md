description: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of examiner experience
  on measurements of bone-loss using high-dose (HD) and low-dose (LD) CBCT. Three
  diagnosticians with varying levels of CBCT interpretation experience measured bone-loss
  from CBCT scans of three cadaveric heads at 30 sites, conducting measurements twice.
  Between the first and second measurements, diagnostician 2 and diagnostician 3 received
  training in LD-CBCT diagnostics. The diagnosticians also classified the ...
