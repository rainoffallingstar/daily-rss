description: Control of cell-type-specific gene activation requires the coordinated
  activity of distal regulatory elements, including enhancers, whose inputs must be
  temporally integrated. Dysregulation of this regulatory capacity, such as aberrant
  usage of enhancers, can result in malignant transformation of cells. In this review,
  we provide an overview of our current understanding of enhancer-driven gene regulation
  and discuss how this activity may be integrated across time, followed by epigenetic
