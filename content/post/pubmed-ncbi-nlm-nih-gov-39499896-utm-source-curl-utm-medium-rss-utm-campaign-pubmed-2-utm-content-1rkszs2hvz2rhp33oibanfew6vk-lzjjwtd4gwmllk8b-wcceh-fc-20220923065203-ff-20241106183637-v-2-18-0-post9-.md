description: Small molecules promoting protein-protein interactions produce a range
  of therapeutic outcomes. Molecular glue degraders exemplify this concept due to
  their compact drug-like structures and ability to engage targets without reliance
  on existing cognate ligands. While cereblon molecular glue degraders containing
  glutarimide scaffolds have been approved for treatment of multiple myeloma and acute
