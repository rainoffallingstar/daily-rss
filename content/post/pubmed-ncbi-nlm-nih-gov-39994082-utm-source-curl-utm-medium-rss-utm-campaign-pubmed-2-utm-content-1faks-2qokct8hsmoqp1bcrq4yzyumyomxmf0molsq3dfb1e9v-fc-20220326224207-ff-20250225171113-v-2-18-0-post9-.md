description: The Woven EndoBridge (WEB) device is FDA-approved for the treatment of
  bifurcation aneurysms. Despite its wide popularity, it has been under scrutiny for
  its association with potential aneurysm recanalization and retreatment due to device
  shape modification. This study aims to analyze the shape modification rate of WEB
  devices and identify factors associated with this phenomenon, as well as its correlation
