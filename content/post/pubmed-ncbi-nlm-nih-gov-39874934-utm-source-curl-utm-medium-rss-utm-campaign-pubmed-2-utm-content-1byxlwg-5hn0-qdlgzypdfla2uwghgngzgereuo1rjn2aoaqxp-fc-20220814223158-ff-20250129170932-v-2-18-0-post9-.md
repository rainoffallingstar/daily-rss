CONCLUSIONS: VAE-Surv enables automatic identification of patients' clusters, while outperforming the traditional CoxPH model in survival prediction tasks at the same time. Applied to MDS use case, the obtained genetic-based clusters exhibit a clear survival stratification, and the application of the clinical information allowed high performance in prognosis ...
