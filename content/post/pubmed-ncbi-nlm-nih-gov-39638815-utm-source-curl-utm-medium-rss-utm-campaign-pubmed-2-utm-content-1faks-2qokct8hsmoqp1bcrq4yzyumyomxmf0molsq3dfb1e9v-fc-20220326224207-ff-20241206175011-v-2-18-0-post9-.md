description: Tannic acid (TA) is a potent antitumor agent, but its low bioavailability
  and absorption limit its use. In this study, it was loaded into chitosan-based nanoparticles
  (Chi-NPs) to overcome these limitations and to improve its antimicrobial and anticancer
  activities. TA-loaded Chi-NPs (Chi-TA-NPs) were synthesized using the ionic gelation
  method and physicochemically characterized by FE-SEM, FTIR, XRD, PDI, DLS, and zeta
  potential analysis. Additionally, the antimicrobial activity of ...
