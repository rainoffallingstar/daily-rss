description: 'Background: Vitamin D is a fat-soluble steroid that influences cardiovascular
  health by affecting lipid metabolism. Since dyslipidemia is a key risk factor for
  cardiovascular disease (CVD), our study aimed to explore the relationship between
  vitamin D levels and lipid parameters, considering the effects of age and gender.
  Methods: In this cross-sectional study of 47,778 outpatients, we analyzed correlations
  between two forms of vitamin D-25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
