description: Background The level of background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) at breast
  MRI provides predictive and prognostic information and can have diagnostic implications.
  However, there is a lack of standardization regarding BPE assessment. Purpose To
  investigate how well results of quantitative BPE assessment methods correlate among
  themselves and with assessments made by radiologists experienced in breast MRI.
  Materials and Methods In this pseudoprospective analysis of 5773 breast MRI ...
