description: The incidence of cataract is expected to increase, primarily due to an
  aging population. However, human-induced environmental changes may also contribute.
  In this narrative review, we explore the connection between climate change, the
  depletion of the ozone layer, and modifiable risk factors for cataract development
  such as UV light exposure and pollution-related factors. Finally, we discuss preventative
  measures at both the individual and the societal level, including strategies to
