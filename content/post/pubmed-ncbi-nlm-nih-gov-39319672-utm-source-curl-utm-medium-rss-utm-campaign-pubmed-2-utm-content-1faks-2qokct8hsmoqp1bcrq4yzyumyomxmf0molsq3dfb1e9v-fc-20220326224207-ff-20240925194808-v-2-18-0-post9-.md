description: India's mango productivity is hindered by many factors but more importantly
  due to limited understanding of the genomic complexities behind regular bearing
  habit. This study is the first to quantify carbohydrate fractions, protein content,
  and macro and micronutrient storage pools, their transportation, and contributions
  to regular 'Totapuri' and alternate bearer 'Bombay Green' mango varieties during
  the 'off' year. Deep RNA sequencing was used to assess gene expression dynamics
  between buds ...
