description: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive degenerative joint disorder with
  cartilage degradation as the primary cause of joint pain and loss of joint function.
  B-cell lymphoma-2-associated transcription factor 1 (BCLAF1) is a key regulator
  of apoptosis and serves as a signal transducer of the NFκB and Hif-1α pathways,
  both of which are involved in osteoarthritic cartilage degradation. However, whether
  BCLAF1 contributes to the pathogenesis of OA remains unclear. The present study
