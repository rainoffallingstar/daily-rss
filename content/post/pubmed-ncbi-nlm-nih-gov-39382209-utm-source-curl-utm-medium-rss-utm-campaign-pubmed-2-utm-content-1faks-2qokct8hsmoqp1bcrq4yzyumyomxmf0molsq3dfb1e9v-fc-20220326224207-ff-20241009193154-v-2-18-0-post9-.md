description: Graphite is one of only a few layered materials that can be exfoliated
  into nanosheets with semimetallic properties, which limits the applications of nanosheet-based
  electrodes to material combinations compatible with the work function of graphene.
  It is therefore important to identify additional metallic or semimetallic two-dimensional
  (2D) nanomaterials that can be processed in solution for scalable fabrication of
  printed electronic devices. Metal diborides represent a family of ...
