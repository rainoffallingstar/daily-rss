description: We present a merged-beams study of reactions between HD^{+} ions, stored
  in the Cryogenic Storage Ring (CSR), and laser-produced ground-term C atoms. The
  molecular ions are stored for up to 20 s in the extreme vacuum of the CSR, where
  they have time to relax radiatively until they reach their vibrational ground state
  (within 0.5 s of storage) and rotational states with J≤3 (after 5 s). We combine
  our experimental studies with quasiclassical trajectory calculations based on two
  reactive ...
