description: We present the open-source SIMUnet code, designed to fit Standard Model
  Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) Wilson coefficient alongside Parton Distribution
  Functions (PDFs) of the proton. SIMUnet can perform SMEFT global fits, as well as
  simultaneous fits of the PDFs and of an arbitrarily large number of SMEFT degrees
  of freedom, by including both PDF-dependent and PDF-independent observables. SIMUnet
  can also be used to determine whether the effects of any New Physics models can
  be fitted away in ...
