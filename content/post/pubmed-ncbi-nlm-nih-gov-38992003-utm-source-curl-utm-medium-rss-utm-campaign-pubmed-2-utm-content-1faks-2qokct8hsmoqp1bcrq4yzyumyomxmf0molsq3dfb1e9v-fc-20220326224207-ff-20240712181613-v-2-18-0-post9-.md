description: We present Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Cell Therapy (DEBCT), a scalable
  platform producing autologous organotypic iPS cell-derived induced skin composite
  (iSC) grafts for definitive treatment. Clinical-grade manufacturing integrates CRISPR-mediated
  genetic correction with reprogramming into one step, accelerating derivation of
  COL7A1-edited iPS cells from patients. Differentiation into epidermal, dermal and
  melanocyte progenitors is followed by CD49f-enrichment, minimizing ...
