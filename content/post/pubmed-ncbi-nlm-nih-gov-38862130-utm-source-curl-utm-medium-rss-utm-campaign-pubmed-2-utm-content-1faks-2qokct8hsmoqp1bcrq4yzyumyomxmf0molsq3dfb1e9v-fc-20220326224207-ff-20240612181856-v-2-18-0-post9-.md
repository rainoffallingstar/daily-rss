description: The higher acenes and azaacenes (>(aza)heptacenes) are fascinating, yet
  elusive materials. Their reactivity and sensitivity increases concomitantly with
  their size. In recent years, confinement techniques, that is isolation of acenes
  in matrices and on surfaces, has surpassed solution-based chemistry with respect
  to accessing the larger (hetero)acenes at the price of the accessibility of no more
  than a couple thousands of molecules. Isolating acenes in bulk quantities and in
  processable form ...
