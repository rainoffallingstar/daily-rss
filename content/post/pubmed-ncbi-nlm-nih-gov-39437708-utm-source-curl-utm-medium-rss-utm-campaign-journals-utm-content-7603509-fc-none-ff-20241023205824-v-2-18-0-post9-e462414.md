description: TP53-mutant mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is associated with poor survival
  outcomes with standard chemoimmunotherapy. Dual BTK and BCL2-inhibition with or
  without anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy has shown promising activity in TP53-mutant
  MCL. We conducted a multi-center phase 2 study of zanubrutinib, obinutuzumab, and
  venetoclax (BOVen) in untreated MCL patients with TP53 mutation. Patients initially
  received zanubrutinib 160mg twice daily and obinutuzumab. Obinutuzumab 1000mg was
  given ...
