description: Hereditary angioedema is a potentially life-threatening autosomal dominant
  condition, causing attacks of angioedema due to failure to regulate bradykinin.
  Nearly all cases of hereditary angioedema are caused by mutations in the gene encoding
  C1 inhibitor, SERPING1. C1 inhibitor is a multifunctional protein produced in the
  liver that regulates the kallikrein-kinin system at multiple points. An infant with
  genetically confirmed hereditary angioedema and low C1 inhibitor levels (but ...
