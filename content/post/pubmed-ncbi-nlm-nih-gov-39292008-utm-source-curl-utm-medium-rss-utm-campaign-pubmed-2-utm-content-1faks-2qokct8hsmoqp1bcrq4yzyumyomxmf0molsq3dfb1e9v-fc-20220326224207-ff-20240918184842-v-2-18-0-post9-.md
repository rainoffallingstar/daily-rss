description: In the aquaculture sector, one of the challenges includes disease outbreaks
  such as bacterial infections, particularly from Aeromonas hydrophila (Ah), impacting
  both wild and farmed fish. In this study, we conducted a proteomic analysis of the
  intestinal tissue in Labeo rohita following Ah infection to elucidate the protein
  alterations and its implications for immune response. Our findings indicate significant
  dysregulation in extracellular matrix (ECM)-associated proteins during Ah ...
