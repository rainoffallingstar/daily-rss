description: In patients with COVID-19, broad panels of immune checkpoint molecules
  (ICPMs) and the purinergic signaling have not been studied in parallel. We aimed
  to perform in-depth immunophenotyping of major cell subsets present in human peripheral
  blood of COVID-19 patients and controls using PD1, TIM3, LAG3, TIGIT, and CD200R,
  as well as CD39, as markers for the purinergic signaling pathway. We studied 76
  COVID-19 patients and 12 healthy controls using peripheral blood mononuclear cells
