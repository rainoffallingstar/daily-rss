description: Diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL) are highly aggressive tumors.
  Their genetic complexity and heterogeneity have hampered the development of novel
  approaches for precision medicine. Our study aimed to develop a personalized therapy
  for DLBCL by utilizing the CRISPR/Cas system to induce knockouts (KO) of driver
  genes, thereby causing cancer cell death while minimizing side effects. We focused
  on OCI-LY3 cells, modeling DLBCL, and compared them with BJAB cells as controls.
