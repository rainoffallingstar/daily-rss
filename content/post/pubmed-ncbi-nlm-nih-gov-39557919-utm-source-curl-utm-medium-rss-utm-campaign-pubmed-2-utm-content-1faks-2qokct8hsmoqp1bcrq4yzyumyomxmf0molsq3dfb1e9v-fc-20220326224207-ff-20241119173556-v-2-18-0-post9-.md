description: Chitinase-like proteins have multiple biological functions that promote
  tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. Expression of CHI3L2, which is similar
  in structure to CHI3L1, is detected in glioma cells and tumor-associated macrophages
  (TAMs) in glioma and breast cancer. However, its exact role remains unclear. We
  analyzed the expression of CHI3L2 in 74 invasive ductal breast carcinoma (IDC) tumors,
  breast cancer and macrophages cell cultures using immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence,...
