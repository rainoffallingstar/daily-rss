description: Cyclophilin A (CypA), the cellular receptor of the immunosuppressant
  cyclosporin A (CsA), is an abundant cytosolic protein and is involved in a variety
  of diseases. For example, CypA supports cancer proliferation and mediates viral
  infections, such as the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). Here, we present
  the design of PROTAC (proteolysis targeting chimera) compounds against CypA to induce
  its intracellular proteolysis and to investigate their effect on immune cells. Interestingly,
