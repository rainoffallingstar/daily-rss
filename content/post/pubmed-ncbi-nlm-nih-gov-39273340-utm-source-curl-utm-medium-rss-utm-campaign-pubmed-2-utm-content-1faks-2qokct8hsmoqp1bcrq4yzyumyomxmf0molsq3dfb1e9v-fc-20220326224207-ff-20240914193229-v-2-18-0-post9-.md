description: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent primary liver cancer,
  with a high mortality rate due to the limited therapeutic options. Systemic drug
  treatments improve the patient's life expectancy by only a few months. Furthermore,
  the development of novel small molecule chemotherapeutics is time-consuming and
  costly. Drug repurposing has been a successful strategy for identifying and utilizing
  new therapeutic options for diseases with limited treatment options. This study
