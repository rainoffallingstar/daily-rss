  symptoms including affective, cognitive, perceptual, sensorimotor, and social. The
  neuronal mechanisms underlying such co-occurrence of psychopathological symptoms
  remain yet unclear. Rather than linking and localizing single psychopathological
  symptoms to specific regions or networks, this perspective proposes a more global
