description: The clinical effectiveness of Oxiris^(®), particularly in reducing cytokines,
  remains uncertain due to the limited data provided. This study explored and analyzed
  the application value of Oxiris^(®) endotoxin adsorption technology in a large animal
  model. Pigs received an intravenous LPS infusion. Six animals were treated 2 h after
  the infusion with an Oxiris^(®) hemadsorption using a pumpless extracorporeal technique
  for 6 h. Five animals served as controls. Cardiocirculatory ...
