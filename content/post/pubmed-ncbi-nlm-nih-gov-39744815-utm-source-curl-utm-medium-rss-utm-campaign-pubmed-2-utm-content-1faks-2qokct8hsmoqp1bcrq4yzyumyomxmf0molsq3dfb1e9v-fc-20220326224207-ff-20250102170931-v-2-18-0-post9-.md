  recycling and degradation of cellular material. Maintenance of lysosomal integrity
  is essential for cellular homeostasis and lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP)
  sensitizes toward cell death. Damaged lysosomes are repaired or degraded via lysophagy,
  during which glycans, exposed on ruptured lysosomal membranes, are recognized by
