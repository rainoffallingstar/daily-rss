description: The purpose of the review is to summarize clinical and anatomically-related
  aspects of myopia. Recent studies have revealed macular atrophy as myopic maculopathy
  (MMP) stage-4 was accompanied by a central Bruch´s membrane (BM) defect associated
  with a subretinal proliferation (as sign of previous macular neovascularization).
  Patchy atrophies (MMP-stage 3) could be differentiated into those without versus
  with BM defects/subretinal proliferations. BM defects and subretinal proliferations
