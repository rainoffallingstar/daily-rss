description: 'CONCLUSIONS: Our study expands the knowledge of the differences in cellular
  composition of gonadotroph and lactotroph PitNET subtypes. It lays the foundation
  for further studies on the influence of lymphoid cells on the variable aggressive
  behavior of PitNET. Regarding the treatment of drug-resistant lactotroph PitNET,
  proliferative lymphocytes, CD8^(+) T, and NK cells could represent potentially valuable
  targets for developing new cancer ...'
