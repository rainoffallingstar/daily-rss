description: Earth's obliquity and eccentricity cycles are strongly imprinted on Earth's
  climate and widely used to measure geological time. However, the record of these
  imprints on the oxygen isotope record in deep-sea benthic foraminifera (δ^(18)O(b))
  shows contradictory signals that violate isotopic principles and cause controversy
  over climate-ice sheet interactions. Here, we present a δ^(18)O(b) record of high
  fidelity from International Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Site U1406 in the northwest
