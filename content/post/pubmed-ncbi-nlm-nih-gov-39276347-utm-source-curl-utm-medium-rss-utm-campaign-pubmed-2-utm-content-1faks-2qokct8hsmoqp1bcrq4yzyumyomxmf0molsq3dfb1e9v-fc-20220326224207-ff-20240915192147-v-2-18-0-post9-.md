description: Macrophages exhibit diverse phenotypes and respond flexibly to environmental
  cues through metabolic remodeling. In this study, we present a comprehensive multi-omics
  dataset integrating intra- and extracellular metabolomes with transcriptomic data
  to investigate the metabolic impact on human macrophage function. Our analysis establishes
  a metabolite-gene correlation network that characterizes macrophage activation.
  We find that the concurrent inhibition of tryptophan catabolism by IDO1 and ...
