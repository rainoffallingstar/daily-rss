description: Aging and chronic inflammation are associated with overabundant myeloid-primed
  multipotent progenitors (MPPs) amongst hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs).
  While HSC differentiation bias has been considered a primary cause of myeloid bias,
  whether it is sufficient has not been quantitatively evaluated. Here, we analyzed
  bone marrow data from the IκB- (Nfkbia+/-Nfkbib-/-Nfkbie-/-) mouse model of inflammation
  with elevated NFκB activity, which shows increased myeloid-biased MPPs. ...
