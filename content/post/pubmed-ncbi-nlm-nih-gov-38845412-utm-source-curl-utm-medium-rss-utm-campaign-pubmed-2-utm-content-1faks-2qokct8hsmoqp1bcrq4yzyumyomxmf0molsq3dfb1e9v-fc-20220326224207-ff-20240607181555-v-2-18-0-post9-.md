description: SCN8A variants cause a spectrum of epilepsy phenotypes ranging from self-limited
  infantile epilepsy (SeLIE) to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. SeLIE
  is an infantile onset focal epilepsy, occurring in developmentally normal infants,
  which often resolves by 3 years. Our aim was to ascertain when epilepsy resolves
  in SCN8A-SeLIE. We identified unpublished individuals with SCN8A-SeLIE and performed
  detailed phenotyping. Literature was searched for published SCN8A-SeLIE cases. ...
