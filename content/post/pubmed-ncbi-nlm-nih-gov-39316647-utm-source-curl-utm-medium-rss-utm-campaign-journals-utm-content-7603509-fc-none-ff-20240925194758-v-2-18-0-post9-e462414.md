description: Iron regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2) play a pivotal role in maintaining
  cellular iron homeostasis by binding to iron-responsive elements (IREs) of target
  mRNAs and regulating the expression of these iron-related genes. Mice and humans
  that lack functional IRP1 develop erythrocytosis due to erythropoietin overproduction,
  whereas those that lack IRP2 develop microcytic anemia believed to result from iron
  deficiency of erythroblasts. Here, we discovered that IRP2 deficiency reduced ...
