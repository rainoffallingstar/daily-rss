description: Natural killer (NK) cells have proven to be safe and effective immunotherapies,
  associated with favorable treatment responses in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
  Augmenting NK cell function with oncological drugs could improve NK cell-based immunotherapies.
  Here, we used a high-throughput drug screen consisting of over 500 small-molecule
  compounds to systematically evaluate the effects of oncological drugs on primary
  NK cells against CML cells. We identified SMAC mimetics as potent enhancers ...
