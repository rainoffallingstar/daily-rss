description: In this community effort, we compare measurements between 34 laboratories
  from 19 countries, utilizing mixtures of labelled authentic synthetic standards,
  to quantify by mass spectrometry four clinically used ceramide species in the NIST
  (National Institute of Standards and Technology) human blood plasma Standard Reference
  Material (SRM) 1950, as well as a set of candidate plasma reference materials (RM
  8231). Participants either utilized a provided validated method and/or their method
