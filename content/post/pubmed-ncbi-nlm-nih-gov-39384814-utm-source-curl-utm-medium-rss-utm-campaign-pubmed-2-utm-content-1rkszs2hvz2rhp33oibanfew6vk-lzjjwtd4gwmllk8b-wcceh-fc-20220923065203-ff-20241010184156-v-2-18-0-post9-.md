description: CBFA2T3-GLIS2 is a fusion oncogene found in pediatric acute megakaryoblastic
  leukemia that is associated with a poor prognosis. We establish a model of CBFA2T3-GLIS2
  driven acute megakaryoblastic leukemia that allows the distinction of fusion specific
  changes from those that reflect the megakaryoblast lineage of this leukemia. Using
  this model, we map fusion genome wide binding that in turn imparts the characteristic
  transcriptional signature. A network of transcription factor genes bound ...
