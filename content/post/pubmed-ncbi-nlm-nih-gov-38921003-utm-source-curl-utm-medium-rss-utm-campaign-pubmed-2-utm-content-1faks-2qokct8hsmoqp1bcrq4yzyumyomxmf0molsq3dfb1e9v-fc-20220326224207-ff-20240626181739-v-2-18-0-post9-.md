description: Extensive research on medicinal herbs for bioactive compounds proposes
  that they could replace synthetic drugs, reducing side effects and economic burdens.
  Especially, interest in the synergistic benefits of natural products is increasing,
  implying that their combined use may enhance therapeutic effectiveness. This study
  aimed to explore the synergetic effects of turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) and black
  pepper (Piper nigrum L.) extract on lung normal (MRC-5) and cancer (A549 and NCI-H292)
