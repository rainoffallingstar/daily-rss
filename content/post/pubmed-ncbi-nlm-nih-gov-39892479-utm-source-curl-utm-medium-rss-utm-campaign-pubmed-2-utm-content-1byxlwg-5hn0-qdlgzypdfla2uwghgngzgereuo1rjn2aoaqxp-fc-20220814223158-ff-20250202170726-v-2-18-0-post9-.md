description: Brain tumor growth is associated with angiogenesis, wherein the density
  of newly developed blood vessels indicates tumor progression and correlates with
  the tumor grade. Quantitative dynamic contrast enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging
  (DCE-MRI) has shown potential in brain tumor grading and treatment response assessment.
  Segmentation of large-blood-vessels is crucial for automatic and accurate tumor
  grading using quantitative DCE-MRI. Traditional manual and semi-manual ...
