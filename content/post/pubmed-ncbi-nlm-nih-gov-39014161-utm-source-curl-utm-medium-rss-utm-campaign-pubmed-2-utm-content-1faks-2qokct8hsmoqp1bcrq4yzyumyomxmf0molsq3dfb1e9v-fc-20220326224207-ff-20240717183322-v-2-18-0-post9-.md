description: Butyrophilin (BTN) molecules are emerging as key regulators of T cell
  immunity; however, how they trigger cell-mediated responses is poorly understood.
  Here, the crystal structure of a gamma-delta T cell antigen receptor (γδTCR) in
  complex with BTN2A1 revealed that BTN2A1 engages the side of the γδTCR, leaving
  the apical TCR surface bioavailable. We reveal that a second γδTCR ligand co-engages
  γδTCR via binding to this accessible apical surface in a BTN3A1-dependent manner.
