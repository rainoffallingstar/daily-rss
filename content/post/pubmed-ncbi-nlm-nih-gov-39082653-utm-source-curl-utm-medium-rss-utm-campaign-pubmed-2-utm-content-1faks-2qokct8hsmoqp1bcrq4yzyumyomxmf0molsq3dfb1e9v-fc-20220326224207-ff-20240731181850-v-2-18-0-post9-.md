description: A biochemical pathway consists of a series of interconnected biochemical
  reactions to accomplish specific life activities. The participating reactants and
  resultant products of a pathway, including gene fragments, proteins, and small molecules,
  coalesce to form a complex reaction network. Biochemical pathways play a critical
  role in the biochemical domain as they can reveal the flow of biochemical reactions
  in living organisms, making them essential for understanding life processes. ...
