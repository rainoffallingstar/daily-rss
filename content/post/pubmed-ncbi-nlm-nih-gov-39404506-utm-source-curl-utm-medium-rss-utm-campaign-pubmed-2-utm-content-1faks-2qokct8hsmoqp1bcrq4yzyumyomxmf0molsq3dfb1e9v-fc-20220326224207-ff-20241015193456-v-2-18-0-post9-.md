description: Carnosine is an endogenous dipeptide characterized by a multimodal mechanism
  of action. However, its clinical potential is limited by serum and cytosolic carnosinases,
  which significantly reduce its bioavailability. Based on that, different research
  groups have worked on the development of new strategies able not only to prevent
  its rapid metabolization but also to improve its distribution and specific targeting.
