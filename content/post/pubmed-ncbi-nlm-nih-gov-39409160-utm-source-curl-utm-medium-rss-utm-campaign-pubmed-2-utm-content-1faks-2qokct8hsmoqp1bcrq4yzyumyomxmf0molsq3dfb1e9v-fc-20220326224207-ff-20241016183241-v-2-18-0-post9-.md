description: Despite advances in treatment modalities, bone tumour therapies still
  face significant challenges. Severe side effects of conventional approaches, such
  as chemo- and radiation therapy, result in poor survival rates and high tumour recurrence
  rates, which are the most common issues that need to be improved upon. The aim of
  this study was to evaluate the therapeutic properties of 45S5 bioactive glass (BG)
  for targeting bone tumours. The viability of the cells derived from ...
