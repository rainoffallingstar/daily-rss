description: Paediatric medulloblastomas with chromothripsis are characterised by
  high genomic instability and are among the tumours with the worst prognosis. However,
  the molecular makeup and the determinants of the aggressiveness of chromothriptic
  medulloblastoma are not well understood. Here, we apply spatial transcriptomics
  to profile a cohort of 13 chromothriptic and non-chromothriptic medulloblastomas
  from the same molecular subgroup. Our data reveal a higher extent of spatial ...
