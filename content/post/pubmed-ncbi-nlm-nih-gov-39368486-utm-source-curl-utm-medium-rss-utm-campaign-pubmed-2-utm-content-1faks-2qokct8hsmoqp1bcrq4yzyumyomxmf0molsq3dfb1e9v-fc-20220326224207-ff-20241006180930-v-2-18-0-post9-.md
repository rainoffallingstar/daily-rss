description: To improve immunotherapy for brain tumors, it is important to determine
  the principal intracranial site of T cell recruitment from the bloodstream and their
  intracranial route to brain tumors. Using intravital microscopy in mouse models
  of intracranial melanoma, we discovered that circulating T cells preferably adhered
