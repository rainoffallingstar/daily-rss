description: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with the t(7;12)(q36;p13) translocation
  occurs only in very young children and has a poor clinical outcome. The expected
  oncofusion between breakpoint partners (MNX1 and ETV6) has only been reported in
  a subset of cases. However, a universal feature is the strong transcript and protein
  expression of MNX1, a homeobox transcription factor that is normally not expressed
  in hematopoietic cells. Here, we map the translocation breakpoints on chromosomes
  7 and 12 ...
