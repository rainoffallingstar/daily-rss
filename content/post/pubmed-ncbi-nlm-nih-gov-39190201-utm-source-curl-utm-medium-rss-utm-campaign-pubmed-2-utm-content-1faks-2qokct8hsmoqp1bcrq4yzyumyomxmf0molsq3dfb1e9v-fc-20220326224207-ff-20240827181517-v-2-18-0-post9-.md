description: To improve the prognosis of bladder and prostate cancer, highly specific
  and sensitive biomarkers are needed for early detection, prognosis prediction, and
  therapeutic stratification. Extracellular vesicles (EV) from plasma could fill this
  gap due to their potential to serve as cancer biomarkers. However, the enrichment
  of EV is a major challenge, because the highly abundant plasma proteins are interfering
  with analytical downstream applications like mass spectrometry (MS). Therefore,
