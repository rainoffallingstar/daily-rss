description: Autism has been associated with differences in functional brain network
  organization. However, the exact nature of these differences across development
  compared to non-autistic individuals and their relationship to autism-related social
  cognition, remains unclear. This study first aimed to identify EEG resting-state
  network characteristics in autistic versus non-autistic children, adolescents, and
  adults. Second, we investigated associations with social cognition measures. ...
