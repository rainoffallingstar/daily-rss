description: The development of a fatal, clonal, autonomously proliferating CD4-CD8-
  chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)+ peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) occurred 1 month
  after a patient received treatment with tisagenlecleucel for relapsed primary central
  nervous system lymphoma. The PTCL had a clonal T-cell receptor rearrangement, which
  was already detectable in the apheresis product for CAR T-cell manufacturing and
  7 months earlier for autologous transplantation. Somatic DNMT3A and TET2 mutations
