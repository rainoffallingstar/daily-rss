description: Access to clean water, hygiene, and sanitation is becoming an increasingly
  pressing global demand, particularly owing to rapid population growth and urbanization.
  Phytoremediation utilizes a highly conserved phytochelatin in plants, which captures
  hazardous heavy metal ions from aquatic environments and sequesters them in vacuoles.
  Herein, we report the design of phytochelatin-inspired copolymers containing carboxylate
  and thiolate moieties. Titration calorimetry results indicate that ...
