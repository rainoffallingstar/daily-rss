description: Mammalian pluripotent cells first segregate into neuroectoderm (NE),
  or mesoderm and endoderm (ME), characterized by lineage-specific transcriptional
  programs and chromatin states. To date, the relationship between transcription factor
  activities and dynamic chromatin changes that guide cell specification remains ill-defined.
  In this study, we employ mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation toward ME lineages
  to reveal crucial roles of the Tbx factor Eomes to globally establish ME ...
