description: Thermodynamic integration (TI) offers a rigorous method for estimating
  free-energy differences by integrating over a sequence of interpolating conformational
  ensembles. However, TI calculations are computationally expensive and typically
  limited to coupling a small number of degrees of freedom due to the need to sample
  numerous intermediate ensembles with sufficient conformational-space overlap. In
