description: The precise control of gene expression is required for the maintenance
  of cellular homeostasis and proper cellular function, and the declining control
  of gene expression with age is considered a major contributor to age-associated
  changes in cellular physiology and disease. The coordination of gene expression
  can be represented through models of the molecular interactions that govern gene
  expression levels, so-called gene regulatory networks. Gene regulatory networks
  can represent ...
