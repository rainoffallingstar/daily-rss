description: Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are rare vascular malformations
  of the lungs. Direct communication of pulmonary arteries to pulmonary veins is the
  defining characteristic allowing venous blood to bypass the pulmonary capillary
  system and avoiding an efficient oxygenation process. The complexity of the pathology
  lies not only in the variety of its manifestations, but also in the choice of the
  most appropriate and effective treatment. We present a case of a complex PAVM ...
