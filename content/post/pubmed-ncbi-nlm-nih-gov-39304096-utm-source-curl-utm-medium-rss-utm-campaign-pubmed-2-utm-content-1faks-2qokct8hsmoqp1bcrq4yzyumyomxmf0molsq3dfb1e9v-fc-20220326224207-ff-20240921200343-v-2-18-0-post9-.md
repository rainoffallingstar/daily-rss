description: Zymosan is a β-glucan-rich component derived from the cell walls of Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae extensively used in research for its potent immunomodulatory properties.
  It can prompt inflammatory responses such as peritonitis and arthritis, and is particularly
  used to study the immune response to fungal particles. Although the zymosan induced-release
  of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β by macrophages is an essential mechanism for
  combating fungal infection and inducing inflammation, the ...
