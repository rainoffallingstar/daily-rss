description: Radiotherapy of prostate cancer (PC) can lead to the acquisition of radioresistance
  through molecular mechanisms that involve, in part, cell adhesion-mediated signaling.
  To define these mechanisms, we employed a DU145 PC model to conduct a comparative
  mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of the purified integrin nexus, i.e.,
  the cell-matrix junction where integrins bridge assembled extracellular matrix (matrisome
  components) to adhesion signaling complexes (adhesome components). ...
