description: X-ray-induced damage is one of the key topics in radiation chemistry.
  Substantial damage is attributed to low-energy electrons and radicals emerging from
  direct inner-shell photoionization or produced by subsequent processes. We apply
  multi-electron coincidence spectroscopy to X-ray-irradiated aqueous solutions of
  inorganic ions to investigate the production of low-energy electrons (LEEs) in a
  predicted cascade of intermolecular charge- and energy-transfer processes, ...
