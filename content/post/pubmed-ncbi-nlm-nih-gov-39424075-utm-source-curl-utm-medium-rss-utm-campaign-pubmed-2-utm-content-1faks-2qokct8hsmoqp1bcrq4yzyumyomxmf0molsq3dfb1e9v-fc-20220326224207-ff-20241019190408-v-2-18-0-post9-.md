description: Vitreous floaters are visual phenomena resulting from floating opacities
  inside the eye that disturb vision. The opacities consist of microscopic collagen
  fibers that aggregate in myopia and during aging. These collagen fibers are then
  seen as irregular, sometimes worm-like shadows or structures of a translucent to
  black color. Because of the floating aspect, they tend to follow the movements of
  the eye, causing distress and having a negative impact on a patient's quality of
  life due ...
