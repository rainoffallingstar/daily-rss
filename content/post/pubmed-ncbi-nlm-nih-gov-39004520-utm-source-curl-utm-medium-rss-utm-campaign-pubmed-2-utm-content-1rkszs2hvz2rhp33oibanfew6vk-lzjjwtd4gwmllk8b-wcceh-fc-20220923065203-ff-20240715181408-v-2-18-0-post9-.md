description: The optimal treatment of classic Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) requires an individualized
  approach, with therapy guided by pretreatment clinical risk stratification and interim
  response assessment with positron emission tomography (PET). The overall goal is
  to achieve high cure rates while minimizing acute toxicity and late therapy-related
  effects. Interim PET-adapted strategies (iPET) were initially developed with traditional
  chemotherapy, reducing intensity after interim complete response ...
