description: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease,
  and it consumes considerable medical resources with increasing number of patients
  every year. Mounting evidence show that the regulatory disruptions altering the
  intrinsic activity of genes in brain cells contribute to AD pathogenesis. To gain
  insights into the underlying gene regulation in AD, we proposed a graph learning
  method, Single-Cell based Regulatory Network (SCRN), to identify the regulatory
  mechanisms based ...
