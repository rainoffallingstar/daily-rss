description: Diabetes insipidus (DI) in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)
  and chromosome 3q alterations (EVI1/PRDM3/MECOM overexpression) constitutes a poorly
  understood paraneoplasia. A 44-year-old patient presented with clinical and morphological
  features of this syndrome but, surprisingly, disclosed the rare translocation t(1;2)(p36;p21),
  with massive PRDM16 overexpression. WGS and RNA sequencing suggest enhancer hijacking
  of the ZFP36L2 enhancer region as underlying mechanism. ...
