description: Given the successful graft-versus-leukemia cell treatment effect observed
  with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant for patients with refractory
  or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia, immunotherapies have also been investigated
  in the nontransplant setting. Here, we use a multi-omic approach to investigate
  spatiotemporal interactions in the bone marrow niche between leukemia cells and
  immune cells in patients with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia treated
  with a combination ...
