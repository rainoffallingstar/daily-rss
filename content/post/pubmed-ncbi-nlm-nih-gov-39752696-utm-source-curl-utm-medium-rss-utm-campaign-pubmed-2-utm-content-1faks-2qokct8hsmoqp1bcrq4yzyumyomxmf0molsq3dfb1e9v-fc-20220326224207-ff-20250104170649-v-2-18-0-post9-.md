description: High-energy nuclear collisions create a quark-gluon plasma, whose initial
  condition and subsequent expansion vary from event to event, impacting the distribution
  of the eventwise average transverse momentum [P([p_{T}])]. Disentangling the contributions
  from fluctuations in the nuclear overlap size (geometrical component) and other
  sources at a fixed size (intrinsic component) remains a challenge. This problem
  is addressed by measuring the mean, variance, and skewness of P([p_{T}]) ...
