description: RICTOR is a key component of the mTORC2 signaling complex which is involved
  in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation and survival. RICTOR is highly expressed
  in neurons and is necessary for brain development. Here, we report eight unrelated
  patients presenting with intellectual disability and/or development delay and carrying
  variants in the RICTOR gene. The phenotypic presentation is diverse with associated
  features including growth failure, feeding difficulties, abnormal ...
