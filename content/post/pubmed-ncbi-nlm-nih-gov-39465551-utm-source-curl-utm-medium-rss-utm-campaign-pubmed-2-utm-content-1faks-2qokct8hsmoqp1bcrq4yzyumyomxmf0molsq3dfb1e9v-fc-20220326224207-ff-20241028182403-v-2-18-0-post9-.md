description: Computer assisted orthopedic surgery is used to improve precision. Electro-magnetic
  tracking has been shown to improve precision in mono-planar derotational osteotomies.
  However, studies are lacking to investigate its use in multiplanar osteotomies.
  For this purpose, 60 complex (derotation and extension) osteotomies were performed
  in standardized sawbones. Correction amount was randomly planned before the procedures.
  In 30 bones, the amount of correction was determined intraoperatively ...
