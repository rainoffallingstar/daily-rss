description: The dystrophin protein has well-characterized roles in force transmission
  and maintaining membrane integrity during muscle contraction. Studies have reported
  decreased expression of dystrophin in atrophying muscles during wasting conditions,
  and that restoration of dystrophin can attenuate atrophy, suggesting a role in maintaining
  muscle mass. Phosphorylation of S3059 within the cysteine-rich region of dystrophin
  enhances binding between dystrophin and β-dystroglycan, and ...
