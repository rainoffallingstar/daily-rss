description: Venetoclax, a first-in-class BH3 mimetic drug targeting BCL-2, has improved
  outcomes for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Early measurements
  of the depth of the venetoclax treatment response, assessed by minimal residual
  disease, are strong predictors of long-term clinical outcomes. Yet, there are limited
  data concerning the early changes induced by venetoclax treatment that might inform
