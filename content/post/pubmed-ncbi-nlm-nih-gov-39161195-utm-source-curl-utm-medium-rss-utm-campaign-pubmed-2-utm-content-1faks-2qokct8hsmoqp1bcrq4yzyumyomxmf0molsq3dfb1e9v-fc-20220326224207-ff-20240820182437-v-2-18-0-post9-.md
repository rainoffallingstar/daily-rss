description: In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), TP53 mutations or deletions on
  chromosome 17p lead to adverse prognosis and reduced levels of miR-34a, which targets
  NOTCH1. Also, hyperactivated NOTCH1 signaling is crucial for CLL progression. Here
  we explored the interaction between p53, miR-34a, and NOTCH1 in CLL. We investigated
  the effect of p53 and miR-34a on NOTCH1 signaling and expression in CLL cells with
  altered TP53. Our results indicate that miR-34a reduces NOTCH1 3' UTR activity but
  might ...
