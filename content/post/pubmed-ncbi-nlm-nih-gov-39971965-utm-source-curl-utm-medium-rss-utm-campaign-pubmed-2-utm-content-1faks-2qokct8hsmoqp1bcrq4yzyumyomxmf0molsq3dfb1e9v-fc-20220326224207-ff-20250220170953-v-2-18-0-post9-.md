description: The role of germline genetics in adjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) treatment
  efficacy in ER-positive breast cancer is poorly understood. We employed a two-stage
  candidate gene approach to examine associations between survival endpoints and common
  germline variants in 753 endocrine resistance-related genes. For a discovery cohort,
  we screened the Breast Cancer Association Consortium database (n ≥ 90,000 cases)
  and retrieved 2789 AI-treated patients. Cox model-based analysis revealed 125 ...
