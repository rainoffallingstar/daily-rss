description: An increasing number of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapeutics have
  been developed, not as cytotoxic therapies, but rather as targeted agents able to
  restore the aberrant and leukemogenic "block" in normal differentiation. All-trans
  retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO) are classic examples of differentiating
  agents for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL); newer therapies functioning
  through differentiation include isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 ...
