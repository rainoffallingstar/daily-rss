description: Z boson events at the Large Hadron Collider can be selected with high
  purity and are sensitive to a diverse range of QCD phenomena. As a result, these
  events are often used to probe the nature of the strong force, improve Monte Carlo
  event generators, and search for deviations from standard model predictions. All
  previous measurements of Z boson production characterize the event properties using
  a small number of observables and present the results as differential cross sections
