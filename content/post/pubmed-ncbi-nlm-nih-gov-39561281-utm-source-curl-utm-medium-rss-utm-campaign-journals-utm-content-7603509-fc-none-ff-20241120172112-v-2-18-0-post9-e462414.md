description: Approximately 30% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients express CD7
  on their myeloblasts. We have previously demonstrated that scFv-based "naturally
  selected" CD7 CAR-T (NS7CAR-T) therapy shows significant efficacy with a favorable
  safety profile in T-cell lymphoid malignancies. Here we derived dual nanobody-based
  dVHH NS7CAR-T cells that have superior CD7 binding specificity, affinity to their
  scFv-based counterparts and improved proliferative capability. In this phase I clinical
  trial, ...
