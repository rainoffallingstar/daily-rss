description: In addition to biological factors, maternal exposures during pregnancy
  can contribute to leukemogenesis in offspring. We conducted a population-based cohort
  study in Sweden to investigate the association between risk of acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia (ALL) in offspring and maternal anthropometrics during pregnancy. A total
  of 2,961,435 live-born singletons during 1983-2018 were followed from birth to ALL
  diagnosis, end of age 18, or end of 2018. 1388 children were diagnosed with ALL
