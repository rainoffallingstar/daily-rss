description: We present novoRNABreak, a unified framework for cancer specific novel
  splice junction and fusion transcript detection in RNA-seq data obtained from human
  cancer samples. novoRNABreak is based on a local assembly model, which offers a
  tradeoff between the alignment-based and de novo whole transcriptome assembly (WTA)
  methods. This approach is accurate and sensitive in assembling novel junctions that
  are difficult to directly align or have multiple alignments. Additionally, it is
