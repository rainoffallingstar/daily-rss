description: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a malignant tumor of the digestive system,
  characterized by its aggressive behavior and the absence of effective therapeutic
  biomarkers. Although recent studies have implicated AMDHD1 in tumor formation, its
  role in CCA development has been insufficiently explored. We utilized multiple bioinformatic
  datasets alongside 108 clinical samples to examine AMDHD1 expression in CCA. Then,
  in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to assess its impact on tumor growth
