description: Medulloblastomas (MBs) are malignant pediatric brain tumors that are
  molecularly and clinically heterogenous. The application of omics technologies-mainly
  studying nucleic acids-has significantly improved MB classification and stratification,
  but treatment options are still unsatisfactory. The proteome and their N-glycans
  hold the potential to discover clinically relevant phenotypes and targetable pathways.
