description: During cell division, the microtubule cytoskeleton undergoes dramatic
  cell cycle-driven reorganizations of its architecture. Coordinated by changes in
  the phosphorylation patterns of a multitude of microtubule associated proteins,
  the mitotic spindle first self-assembles to capture the chromosomes and then reorganizes
  in anaphase as the chromosomes are segregated. A key protein for this reorganization
  is PRC1 which is differentially phosphorylated by the mitotic kinases CDK1 and PLK1.
