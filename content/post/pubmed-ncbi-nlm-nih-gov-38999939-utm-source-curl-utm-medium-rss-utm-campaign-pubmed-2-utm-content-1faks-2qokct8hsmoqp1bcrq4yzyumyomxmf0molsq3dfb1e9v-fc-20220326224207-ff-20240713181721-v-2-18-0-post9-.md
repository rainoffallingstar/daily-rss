description: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by reduced left ventricular
  ejection fraction (LVEF) and left or biventricular dilatation. We evaluated sex-specific
  associations of circulating proteins and metabolites with structural and functional
  heart parameters in DCM. Plasma samples (297 men, 71 women) were analyzed for proteins
  using Olink assays (targeted analysis) or LC-MS/MS (untargeted analysis), and for
  metabolites using LC MS/MS (Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ p180 Kit). Associations ...
