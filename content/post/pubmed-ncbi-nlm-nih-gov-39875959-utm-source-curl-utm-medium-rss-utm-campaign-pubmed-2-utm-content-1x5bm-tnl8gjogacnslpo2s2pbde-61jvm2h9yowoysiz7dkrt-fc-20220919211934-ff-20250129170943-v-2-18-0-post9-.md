description: The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel plays a critical
  role in the electrical activity of the heart, and its blockers can cause serious
  cardiotoxic effects. Thus, screening for hERG channel blockers is a crucial step
  in the drug development process. Many in silico models have been developed to predict
  hERG blockers, which can efficiently save time and resources. However, previous
  methods have found it hard to achieve high performance and to interpret the predictive
  results. ...
