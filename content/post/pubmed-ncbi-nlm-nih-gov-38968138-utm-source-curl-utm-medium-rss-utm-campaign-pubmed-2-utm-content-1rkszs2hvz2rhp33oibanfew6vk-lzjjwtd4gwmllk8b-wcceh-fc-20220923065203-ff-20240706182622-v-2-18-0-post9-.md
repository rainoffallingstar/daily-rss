description: While chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has revolutionized
  the treatment of B-cell malignancies, many patients relapse and therefore strategies
  to improve antitumor immunity are needed. We previously designed a novel autologous
  bispecific CAR targeting CD19 and CD22 (CAR19-22), which was well tolerated and
  associated with high response rates but relapse was common. Interleukin-15 (IL15)
  induces proliferation of diverse immune cells and can augment lymphocyte trafficking.
