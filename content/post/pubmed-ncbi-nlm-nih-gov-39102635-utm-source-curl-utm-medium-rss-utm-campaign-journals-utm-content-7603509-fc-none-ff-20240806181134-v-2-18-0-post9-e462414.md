description: The specification of megakaryocytic (Mk) or erythroid (E) lineages from
  primary human megakaryocytic-erythroid progenitors (MEP) is crucial for hematopoietic
  homeostasis, yet the underlying mechanisms regulating fate specification remain
  elusive. In this study, we identify RUNX1 as a key modulator of gene expression
  during MEP fate specification. Overexpression of RUNX1 in primary human MEP promotes
  Mk specification, while pan-RUNX inhibition favors E specification. Although total
  RUNX1 ...
