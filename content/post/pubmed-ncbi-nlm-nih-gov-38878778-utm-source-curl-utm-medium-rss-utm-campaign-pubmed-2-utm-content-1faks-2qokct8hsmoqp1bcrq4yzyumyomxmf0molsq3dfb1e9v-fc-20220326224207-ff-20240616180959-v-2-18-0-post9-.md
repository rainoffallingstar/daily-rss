description: Inflammation-induced neurodegeneration is a defining feature of multiple
  sclerosis (MS), yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. By dissecting the
  neuronal inflammatory stress response, we discovered that neurons in MS and its
  mouse model induce the stimulator of interferon genes (STING). However, activation
  of neuronal STING requires its detachment from the stromal interaction molecule
  1 (STIM1), a process triggered by glutamate excitotoxicity. This detachment initiates
