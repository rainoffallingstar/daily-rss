description: Although tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy has markedly improved
  the survival of people with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 20-30%
  of people still experienced therapy failure. Data from 1,955 consecutive subjects
  with chronic-phase CML diagnosed by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommendations
  from 1 center receiving initial TKI imatinib or a second-generation (2G-) TKI therapy
  were interrogated to develop a clinical prediction model for TKI therapy failure.
