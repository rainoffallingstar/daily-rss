description: Neutrophils are the first line of defense against invading pathogens.
  Neutrophils execute and modulate immune responses by generating reactive oxygen
  species (ROS). Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is a primary immune deficiency
  disorder of phagocytes, caused by inherited mutations in the genes of the NADPH
  oxidase enzyme. These mutations lead to failure of ROS generation followed by recurrent
  bacterial and fungal infections, frequently associated with hyper-inflammatory manifestations.
