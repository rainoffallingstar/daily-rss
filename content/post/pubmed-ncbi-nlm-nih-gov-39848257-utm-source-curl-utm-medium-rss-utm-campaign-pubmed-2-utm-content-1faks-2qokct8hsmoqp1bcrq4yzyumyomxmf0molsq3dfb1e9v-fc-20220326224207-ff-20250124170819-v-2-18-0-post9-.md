description: 'Presented herein is a nickel-catalyzed chemo- and regioselective three-component
  tandem carboamination and cyclization of terminal alkynes with organoboronic acids
  and anthranils for facile and modular access to 2,3-substituted quinolines. In this
  process, anthranil has dual roles: serving as an electrophilic aminating reagent
  and a redox buffer to suppress the generation of an off-cycle Ni(0) complex. Moreover,
  the anionic acetylacetonate (acac) ligand was found to be vital to ensure ...'
