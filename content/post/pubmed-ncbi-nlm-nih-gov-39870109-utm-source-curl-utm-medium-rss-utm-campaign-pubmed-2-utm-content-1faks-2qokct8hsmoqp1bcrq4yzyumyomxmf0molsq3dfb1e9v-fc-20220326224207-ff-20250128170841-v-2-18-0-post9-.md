description: In this article, our goal is to offer an introduction and overview of
  the diagnostic approach to inherited platelet function defects (iPFDs) for clinicians
  and laboratory personnel who are beginning to engage in the field. We describe the
  most commonly used laboratory methods and propose a diagnostic four-step approach,
  wherein each stage requires a higher level of expertise and more specialized methods.
  It should be noted that our proposed approach differs from the ISTH Guidance on
