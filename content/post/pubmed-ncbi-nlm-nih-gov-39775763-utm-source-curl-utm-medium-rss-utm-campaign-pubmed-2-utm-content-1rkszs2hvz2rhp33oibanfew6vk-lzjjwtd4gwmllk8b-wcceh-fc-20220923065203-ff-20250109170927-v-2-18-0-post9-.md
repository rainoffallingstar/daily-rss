description: BMT CTN 1506 ("MORPHO"; NCT02997202) was a randomized phase 3 study of
  gilteritinib compared to placebo as maintenance therapy after hematopoietic stem
  cell transplantation (HCT) for patients with FLT3-ITD-mutated acute myeloid leukemia
  (AML). A key secondary endpoint was to determine the impact on survival of pre-
  and/or post-HCT measurable residual disease (MRD), as determined using a highly
  sensitive assay for FLT3-ITD mutations. Generally, gilteritinib maintenance therapy
