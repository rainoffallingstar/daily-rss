description: In this work, the ferroelectric and semiconducting properties of the
  organic semiconducting ferroelectric benzotrithiophene tricarboxamide (BTTTA), and
  especially their nonlinear coupling, are theoretically investigated. BTTTA is an
  exponent of a small class of semiconducting organic ferroelectrics for which experiments
  have established a surprising polarization direction dependence of the bulk conductivity
  at finite fields. First, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to investigate
