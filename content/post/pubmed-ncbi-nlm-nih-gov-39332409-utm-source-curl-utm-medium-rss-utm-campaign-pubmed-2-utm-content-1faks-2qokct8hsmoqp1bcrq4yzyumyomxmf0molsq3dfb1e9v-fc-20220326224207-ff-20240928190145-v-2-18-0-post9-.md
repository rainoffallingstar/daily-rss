description: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a severe congenital anomaly
  often accompanied by other structural anomalies and/or neurobehavioral manifestations.
  Rare de novo protein-coding variants and copy-number variations contribute to CDH
  in the population. However, most individuals with CDH remain genetically undiagnosed.
  Here, we perform integrated de novo and common-variant analyses using 1,469 CDH
  individuals, including 1,064 child-parent trios and 6,133 ancestry-matched, unaffected
