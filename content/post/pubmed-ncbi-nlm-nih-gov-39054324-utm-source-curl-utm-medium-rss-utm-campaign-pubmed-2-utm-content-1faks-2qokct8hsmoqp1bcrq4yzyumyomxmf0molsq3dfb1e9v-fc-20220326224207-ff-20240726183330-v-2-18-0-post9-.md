description: Social recognition is essential for the formation of social structures.
  Many times, recognition comes with lesser exploration of familiar animals. This
  lesser exploration has led to the assumption that recognition may be a habituation
  memory. The underlying memory mechanisms and the thereby acquired cortical representations
  of familiar mice have remained largely unknown, however. Here, we introduce an approach
  directly examining the recognition process from volatile body odors among male ...
