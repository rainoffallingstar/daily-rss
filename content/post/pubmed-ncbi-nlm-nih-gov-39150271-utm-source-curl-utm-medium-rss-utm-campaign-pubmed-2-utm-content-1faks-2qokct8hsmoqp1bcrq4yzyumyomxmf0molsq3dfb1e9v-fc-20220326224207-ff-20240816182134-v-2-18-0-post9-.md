description: In this article, we describe curricular materials developed to engage
  undergraduate students in evolutionary thinking around antibiotic resistance using
  the MEGA-plate experiment (Microbial Evolution and Growth Arena). This elegant and
  visual experiment, developed by the Kishony Lab, shows the development of antibiotic
  resistance on the timescale of hours and days. It not only provides important biological
  insights but also captures students' attention, making it a very useful tool ...
