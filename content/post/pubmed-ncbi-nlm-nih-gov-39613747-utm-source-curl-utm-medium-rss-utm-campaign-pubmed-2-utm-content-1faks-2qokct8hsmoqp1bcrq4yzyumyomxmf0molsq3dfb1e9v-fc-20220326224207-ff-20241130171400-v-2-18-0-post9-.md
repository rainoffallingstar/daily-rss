description: The long-term consequences of cancer and its therapy on the patients'
  immune system years after cancer-free survival remain poorly understood. Here, we
  present an in-depth characterization of the bone marrow immune ecosystem of multiple
  myeloma long-term survivors, from initial diagnosis up to 17 years following a single
  therapy line and cancer-free survival. Using comparative single-cell analyses combined
  with molecular, genomic, and functional approaches, we demonstrate that multiple
