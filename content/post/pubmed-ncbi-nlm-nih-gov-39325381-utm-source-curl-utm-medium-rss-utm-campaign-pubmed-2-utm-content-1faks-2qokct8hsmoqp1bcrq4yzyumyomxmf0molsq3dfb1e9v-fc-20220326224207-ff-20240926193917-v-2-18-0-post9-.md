description: There is a trepidation, anxiety, or intuition, which has persisted for
  more than a century, that psychology theories are less anchored in fundamental laws
  than physics theories. Rather than attempt to refute the concern, the present work
  accepts it and tries out candidate explanations. These pertain to empirical laws,
  parsimony, scope, reductionism, falsifiability, mathematical operations (multiplication
  vs. addition), internal coherence, ceteris paribus stipulations, and purposeful
