description: During antigen-driven responses, B cells can differentiate at extra-follicular
  (EF) sites or initiate germinal centers (GCs) in processes that involve interactions
  with T cells. Here, we examined the roles of interleukin (IL)-2 secreted by T helper
  (Th) cells during cognate interactions with activated B cells. IL-2 boosted the
  expansion of EF plasma cells and the secretion of low-mutated immunoglobulin G (IgG).
  Conversely, genetically disrupting IL-2 expression by CD4^(+) T cells, or ...
