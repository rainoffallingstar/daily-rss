description: A 11-electron T-shaped chromium(I)-complex was obtained by reduction
  of a PNP-supported chromium (II) iodide complex. Its d5 high spin electronic structure
  was characterized employing paramagnetic NMR, EPR, UV-Vis and magnetic measurements
  (SQUID). The complex readily reacts with conjugated dialkynes to cleave the internal
  C-C-bond, forming the respective acetylide complexes. Varying the alkyne substituents
  enabled the isolation and characterization of dinuclear dialkynedichromium ...
