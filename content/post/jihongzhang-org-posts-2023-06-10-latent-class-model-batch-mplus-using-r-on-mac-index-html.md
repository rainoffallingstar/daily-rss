  <p><a href="https://www.statmodel.com/glance.shtml">Mplus</a> is a very popular program for varied latent varaible modeling: (1) Structural equation modeling (2) multilevel analysis (3) mixture modeling (latent class model). R, in the other hand, is a general statistical programming language which not limits to certain statistical models. However, there are scarcely online resources illustrate how to run Mplus using R on Mac.</p>
