description: The ability to establish organoids composed exclusively of tumour rather
  than healthy cells is essential for their implementation into clinical practice.
  Organoids have recently emerged as a powerful tool to expand patient material in
  culture and generate modifiable 3D models derived from humans or animal models.
  For translational research, they enable the creation of model systems for an ever-increasing
  number of cell types and diseases. And in personalised medicine, they potentially
