description: A novel superparamagnetic photonic crystal DNA probe (Fe(3)O(4)@SiO(2)@amino@DNA
  SPC) was developed to enable rapid visual detection of Hg^(2+). This unique photonic
  crystal (PC) was synthesized by combining superparamagnetic nanospheres with DNA
  probes. The DNA probe, rich in thymine (T), detects mercury ions through base mismatch,
  resulting in the formation of T-Hg^(2+)-T loop hairpin structures. With the binding
  of Hg^(2+) to the probe attached to superparamagnetic nanospheres, the ...
