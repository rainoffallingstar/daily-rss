description: Single-cell multi-omics techniques, which enable the simultaneous measurement
  of multiple modalities such as RNA gene expression and Assay for Transposase-Accessible
  Chromatin (ATAC) within individual cells, have become a powerful tool for deciphering
  the intricate complexity of cellular systems. Most current methods rely on motif
  databases to establish cross-modality relationships between genes from RNA-seq data
  and peaks from ATAC-seq data. However, these approaches are constrained ...
