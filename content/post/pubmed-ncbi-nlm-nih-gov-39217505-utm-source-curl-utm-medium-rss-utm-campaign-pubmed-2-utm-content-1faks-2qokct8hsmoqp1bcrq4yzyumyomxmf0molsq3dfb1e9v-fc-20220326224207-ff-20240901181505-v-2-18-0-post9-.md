description: Eastern and Western Finns show a striking difference in coronary heart
  disease-related mortality; genetics is a known contributor for this discrepancy.
  Here, we discuss the potential role of DNA methylation in mediating the discrepancy
  in cardiometabolic disease-risk phenotypes between the sub-populations. We used
  data from the Young Finns Study (n = 969) to compare the genome-wide DNA methylation
  levels of East- and West-originating Finns. We identified 21 differentially methylated
  loci (FDR ...
