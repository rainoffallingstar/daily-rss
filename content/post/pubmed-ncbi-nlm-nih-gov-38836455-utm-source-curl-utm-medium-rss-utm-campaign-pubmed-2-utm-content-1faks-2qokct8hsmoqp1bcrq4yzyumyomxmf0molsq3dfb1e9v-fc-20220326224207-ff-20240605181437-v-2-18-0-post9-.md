description: The use of cavities to impact molecular structure and dynamics has become
  popular. As cavities, in particular plasmonic nanocavities, are lossy and the lifetime
  of their modes can be very short, their lossy nature must be incorporated into the
  calculations. The Lindblad master equation is commonly considered an appropriate
  tool to describe this lossy nature. This approach requires the dynamics of the density
  operator and is thus substantially more costly than approaches employing the ...
