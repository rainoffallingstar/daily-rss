description: We present a novel approach to achieve spatial variations in the degree
  of non-covalent functionalization of twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG). The tBLG with
  twist angles varying between ~5° and 7° was non-covalently functionalized with 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile
  (HATCN) molecules. Our results show a correlation between the degree of functionalization
  and the twist angle of tBLG. This correlation was determined through Raman spectroscopy,
  where areas with larger twist ...
