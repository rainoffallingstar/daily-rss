description: The Integrator complex attenuates gene expression via the premature termination
  of RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) at promoter-proximal pausing sites. It is required
  for stimulus response, cell differentiation, and neurodevelopment, but how gene-specific
  and adaptive regulation by Integrator is achieved remains unclear. Here, we identify
  two sites on human Integrator subunits 13/14 that serve as binding hubs for sequence-specific
  transcription factors (TFs) and other transcription effector ...
