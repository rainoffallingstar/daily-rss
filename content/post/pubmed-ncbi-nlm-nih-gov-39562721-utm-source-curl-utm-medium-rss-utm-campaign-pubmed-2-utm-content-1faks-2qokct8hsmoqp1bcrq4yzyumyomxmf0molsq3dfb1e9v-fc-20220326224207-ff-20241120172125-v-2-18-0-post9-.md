description: In patients diagnosed with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or
  B-non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) relapsing after allogeneic stem cell transplantation
  (allo-HCT), it is a standard practice to perform anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor
  (CAR) T-cell therapy. When collected from the patient after allo-HCT, the produced
  CAR-T cells are likely to be donor T-cell-derived, creating unknown safety risks
  due to their potential allo-reactivity. We therefore performed an EBMT registry-based
  study ...
