description: Ceramide transfer protein CERT is the mediator of nonvesicular transfer
  of ceramide from the ER to Golgi. In CERT, START is the domain responsible for the
  binding and transport of ceramide. A wealth of structural data has revealed a helix-grip
  fold surrounding a large hydrophobic cavity holding the ceramide. Yet, little is
  known about the mechanisms by which START releases the ceramide through the polar
  region and into the packed environment of cellular membranes. As such events do
