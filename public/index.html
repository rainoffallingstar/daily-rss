    Background: The pretherapeutic assessment of axillary lymph node status is crucial in staging early breast cancer patients, significantly influencing their further treatment and prognosis. According to current guidelines, patients with clinically unsuspicious axillary status regularly undergo a biopsy of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), whereby metastasis is detected in up to 20% of cases. In recent years, the use of shear wave elastography (SWE) has been studied as an additional ultrasound tool &hellip;

    There is currently no clinically valid biomarker for predicting the growth and prognosis of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). The most promising candidates with the highest diagnostic values are plasma D-dimers and markers of activated neutrophils, i.e., myeloperoxidase (MPO) or cell-free DNA. So far, case-control studies on these markers have been performed almost exclusively using healthy individuals as controls.

    Thyroid eye disease (TED) is a common extrathyroidal manifestation of hyperthyroidism, typically associated with Graves' disease (GD). This condition can cause severe functional limitations as well as significant aesthetic concerns. Treatment for TED patients aims to restore functionality and address aesthetic concerns. Surgical TED treatment is usually performed by orbital wall resection, which effectively decompresses intraorbital tissues and corrects the orbital/ocular disorders. &hellip;
